POS lets face it lots of bad movies are made all the time for those people who work in film you have probably poured a lot of time and effort into many of these plot less wonders sometimes and this is my opinion it is the act of merely making the movie that is important to us to tell a story no matter how simple and unrealistic also the collaborative process is one key characteristic that is unique to film and theater to put on a production of any caliber requires the talents of a varying amount of people depending on its scale to bring its story to life the most intriguing part of american movie however is not the movie being filmed it is the movie maker himself as a character of his own life which demands our attention none of them serve as models of the filmmakers we know and have worked with but i will argue they are archetypes of small parts of us which try to be a part of this cult activity of independent filmmaking alright a very small part of us these are the people who live under the rocks of their own lives and just so happen to be snared by the romance of cinema this leads me to my next argument american movie captures the raw spirit of independent filmmaking bad stories told on nowadays digital film with sloppy effects and horrible performances because this is the best they can do with a budget of a couple thousand dollars rather than a studio budget of several million dollars a day that is the difference between low low low end productions and studio productions the independent filmmaker just wants to create a linear or even a nonlinear story to shoot as well as he can with the money hes investing in himself and the resources around him in order to see a finished product on his rundown tv rugged individualism materializes in every art form i find this film to be a brilliant document of truth for many filmmakers and no im not full of myself man these people are hilarious their problems seem hilarious their characteristics are hilarious best line of the movie its alright   its okay   theres something to live for   jesus told me so said a million times by a funny old man hats off to tom beach chicago rules
