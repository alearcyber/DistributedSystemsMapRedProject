POS in this peculiar movie the themes of the end of days and satan versus jesus are treated in a new fashion jesus doesnt want to open the two last seals and satan is thwarted in his attempt to get another soul into hell armageddon armageddon and jehosaphat turns out to be a  company and the book of life is a little hard to openbr br whats memorable about this movie are the slanted image outoffocus shots and light effects which are effective but sometimes irritating and of course donovan is great as a disillusioned jesus trying to come to terms with what the world and its people have become so do see it if you get the opportunity
