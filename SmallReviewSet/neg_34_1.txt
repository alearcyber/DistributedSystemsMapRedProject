NEG jacqueline hyde starts like any other normal day for telemarketing individual jackie hyde coproducer gabriella hall until her boss robert donovan fires her for taking personal calls at work however its not all bad news as the call she took was from a lawyer informing her that her grandfather malcolm bennett has recently died  that he left her his mansion  fortune why doesnt stuff like that ever happen to me sigh very excited jackie heads on over there  makes herself right at home while looking for the thermostat late one night jackie stumbles upon a secret room where her grandfather stashes the bright red formula that he invented that allows whoever drinks it to change their appearance being a bit on the porky side jackie finally settles on the glamorous jacqueline blythe metz however jackies better looking alterego starts to take controlbr br written coproduced  directed by rolfe kanefsky i thought jacqueline hyde was complete total  utter crap from start to finish  its as simple  straight forward as that according to the opening credits jacqueline hyde was inspired by the classic robert louis stevenson novel the strange case of dr jekyll and mr hyde frankly if mr stevenson could see what was being done to his story here hed turn in his grave for a start i think jacqueline hyde wasis intended to be a horror film the imdb certainly lists it as such but there isnt any horror in it at all apart from just how bad it is i would say that jacqueline hyde is more a softcore porno than anything else  extremely tame with it why sit down  watch this softer than soft porno crap when you can watch you proper hardcore stuff that actually delivers the goods why thats the question i ask here its not even good porn either besides being far too soft its dull boring  the notworthmentioning sex scenes are few  far between the most intelligent aspect of this film is the title which would have been quite clever if not for the fact that another film used the jacqueline hyde  title during the last century  judging by the imdbs plot summary it sounds a hell of a lot better than this piece of rubbish this is one of those films you have to watch yourself to see just how bad it is but just hope that you never get the opportunitybr br director kanefsky was obviously working on a low budget but thats not an excuse these days shot on a digital camcorder the film looks cheap  the few instances of cgi look like they came from a nintendo gameboy the final shocking twist has probably the worst morph effect ive ever seen  is pretty good for a laugh as is the scene when jackies breasts grow via more terrible cgi thats another thing the film takes itself far too seriously the subject matter sucks is far too predictable  makes for a poor film but maybe if the dialogue had been intentionally funny with some dirty porn talk the film might have been more fun to watch alas it isnt so it isnt forget about any decent horror violence or gore as there isnt any apart from a surprisingly bloodless decapitation at the endbr br technically jacqueline hyde is home made film type stuff the photography is of the flat hand held pointshoot variety the music production design  special effects are of a suitably low standard to match the script the acting was awful seriously this is badbr br jacqueline hyde in my opinion a load of crap there is not one positive thing about this turgid film that i can think of any proper film lover will have an almost impossible time trying to find any redeeming value in this crap definitely one to avoid
