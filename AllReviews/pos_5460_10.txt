POS although a made for cable film by hbo it is an enjoyable movie and a fascinating look at the backstabbing and doubledealing world of television allowing the viewer to peek behind the scenes of the socalled late night talk show wars in the early s as jay leno and david letterman competed for the coveted position as host of the tonight show kathy bates gives a bravo performance as lenos mercurial manager helen kushnick and one can feel empathy for what lenoletterman endured at the hands of tv executives it is just as timely now considering the recent events involving the failed attempt by abc to replace nightline with letterman no matter how many times i have seen this film i still find it as much a pleasure to watch as i did when it first aired if this should ever be released on dvd i would certainly add it to my collection
