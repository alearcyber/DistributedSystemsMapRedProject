NEG the plot a trucker kristofferson battles a corrupt sheriff borgnine by getting his fellow truckers to band together and form an unstoppable convoy that stretches for miles and soon creates a national media frenzybr br the negative the films setup is weak and the ending even weaker it has all the goodoleboytrucker clichs without adding anything new in the process it ends up making smokey and the bandit look brilliant and inspired kristofferson is much too laid back for a leading man role and cannot carry the picture borgnines character is portrayed awkwardly at the start he is made to look like a real jerk of a sheriff who overacts to a minor contrivance that starts the whole thing rolling then at the end he is made out to be a little more sympathetic and even secretly siding with kristofferson which doesnt work at all in either case jackie gleason is a much better actor for this type of role the worst part about the movie though is director peckinpahs attempts to throw in a serious message into this silly action flick that does nothing but slow it down and bomb in the processbr br the positive the only good scene in the whole film is the fight sequence inside the truck stop restaurant director peckinpah puts a funny spin to his trademark slow motion violence and the result is amusing unfortunately he starts putting all the action into slow motion during the rest of the picture until it eventually becomes tiring mcgraw is always a pleasure to look at but unfortunately she is given very little to say or dobr br the lowdown if youve read the synopsis than you have essentially seen the movie the song that this movie is based on is pretty good but the movie adds nothing to it and should never have been made this is all very uninspired stuff for such a maverick directorbr br the rating  out of
