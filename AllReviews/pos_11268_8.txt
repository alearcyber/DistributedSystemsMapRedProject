POS this has to be one of the most beautifully morbid films i have ever seen merhige has created a living painting that unfolds with horrific violence sex and a minimalist retelling of the life of jesus christ the high contrast and thick layer of grain make you question yourself as to what you are really seeing at times but the use of texture combined with the extreme contrast create an incredible viewing experience this film is not for everyone i think you have to keep an open mind and not be so quick to condemn this film for its content which if extremely rough but does make a fairly important statement about creation god and humanity whether this film is a work of art or shock value trash is open to discussion
