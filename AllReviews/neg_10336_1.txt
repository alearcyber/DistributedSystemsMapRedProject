NEG i wont go into detail about why this movie deserves an awful rating plenty of other people have already done that suffice it to say that out of the over  movies that ive owned on dvd this is the only one that i got rid of it was so worthless that i couldnt see ever wanting to watch any of it againbr br however i do have a comment on the ridiculously high average rating of  as of  while skimming through the  pages of reviews i saw no rating higher than  stars looking at the voting history  of users rated the movie as  stars or less it looks to me like a few people are stuffing the ballot box to keep this movie off of the imdb bottom  list it would be interesting to see how many of the  users who rated this movie as  stars none of who wrote a review of the movie are actual active usersbr br dont be fooled this movie isnt worth your time
