POS when i first saw this film around  months ago i considered it interesting but little more but it stuck with me that interest grew and grew and i wondered whether my initial boredom and response had more to do with the actual vhs quality rather than the film itself i purchased the criterion dvd box set and it turns out that i was right the second time alexander nevsky is a great film it is rousing and im sure it succeeded in its main aim propaganda against the germansbr br that is the most common criticism against this film and against eisenstein that it is merely propagandist and nothing else its untrue he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived by now the world is far enough beyond joseph stalin to be able to watch eisensteins films as art
