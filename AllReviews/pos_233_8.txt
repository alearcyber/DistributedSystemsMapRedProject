POS im not a big fan of musicals but i was always enamored of ms hayworths looks so i thought id give it a trybr br this may be the best showcase for the multitalented ms hayworth shes never looked lovelier in a film with the possible exception of gilda where she is sex symbol par excellencebr br rita is more than ably assisted by gene kelly and phil silvers the comedy may be dated but it is still quite amusing kelly does one of his tourdeforce dances dancing with the image of himself from a windowbr br but rita drives this whole movie an excellent cast featuring otto kruger and the always wonderful wisecracking eve arden doesnt hurtbr br rita sings rita dances all the while looking impossibly beautiful the music may be short of classic but the lyrics to most of the tunes are quite cleverbr br i find this movie works better than gilda which i regard as a flawed film to ms hayworths credit she also drives gilda and gilda drives any redblooded male insanebr br the film holds up well after all these years much leg candy for the male audience is a nice bonus
