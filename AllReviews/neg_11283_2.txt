NEG although promoted as one of the most sincere turkish films with an amateur cast icecream i scream is more like a caricature of sinceritybr br the plot opens with the dream of ali a traveling icecream salesman in a western anatolia town in which he sees himself becoming successful using the same marketing methods of big icecream companies he dreams of playing in his products tv commercial with beautiful models in bikinis dancing around him as his dream turns into a nightmare he wakes up with a big erection next to his gargantuan wife who rejects to make sex with him for  years with no apparent reason is it because he is not successful in his job apparently because he says he was selling better in the old days when there was no pressure from global icecream companies but this is what he says we actually dont see him suffer that much he still sells good traveling the neighboring villages while his apprentice stays at the shop selling icecream to the people in the town ali blames big companies for using sweetening and coloring agents while he is using real sahlep powdered roots of mountain orchids ali buys a motorbike with a bank loan to be a traveling vendor and gives ads to a local tv channel which prefers to broadcast even the news bulletin in local dialect his wife is not fond of his ways of doing business they always quarrel and ali threatens her that he may do very bad things in a moment of frenzybr br in a very successful day his lousy bike is stolen by the misbehaving little boys of the town in search of his stolen bike ali goes to the police blames the big companies for the theft but of course nobody takes him seriously annoyed by the nagging of his wife ali goes to a tavern and becomes drunk one of his friends at his table a wannabe socialist of the town gives a didactic speech and criticizes globalism and with no real connection jumps to the subject of global freezing ali returns home and decides to kill himself with poison his wife wakes up and prevents him an old neighbor takes him to a night walk and advises him about life according to him ali can even sell hot sahlep drink if the world faces with global freezing when he returns home suddenly we see that his wife understood his value treating him like a hero and praising his manhood meanwhile the thief boys got sick eating too much icecream they confess to the doctor that they stole alis bike ali forgives them and there comes the happy endbr br although the plot may look promising in a way its the storytelling which makes this film insincere and cheesy first the director doesnt show much of an effort to tell the story visually everything is based on dialogs and the dialogs never stop to show us that cinema is actually a visual art even alis troubles are not convincing because we dont see it we just understand it from his words the director markets his film as a righteous fight of ali against big icecream companies but there is nothing in the film about big companies we dont see their pressure enough the film actually ridicules ali for believing that big companies are behind the theft and when his motorbike is found it solves every problem ali becomes a happy and powerful husband not a real criticism of globalismbr br second the film is cheesy because of the crude humor maybe the people of that part of turkey is cursing so much and making so many vulgar jokes in their daily life but vulgar language and crude humor are not enough to make a film funny i may have accepted it if they were both vulgar and clever but they are not clever jokes at all they are just cheesy maybe im wrong maybe american people may like oriental version of american pie style humor but american pie never had any claim to be a nominee for the oscars or to have a political message if you think that you can laugh by just seeing a mans big erection in his shorts and we had to endure this joke twice or an old villager woman saying fk you then you may find this film funny
