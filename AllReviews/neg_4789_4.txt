NEG i agree with the comments regarding the downward spin the last view shows have been a little better but surely the writers need some more direction i think the characters are still interesting although sometimes they spin into the white trash things a little too much subtlety and nuance goes a long way on shows like office i would think the target audience is somewhat similar being they are both on the same night and lineup one would think that karma and the whole eastern religion thing is a big enough topic to bring some different and interesting shows but they only scratch the surface of the subject in my opinion it shows the contempt that many people have in hollywood about the level of intelligence of the masses we can handle more heady content it has been proved before in many other shows
