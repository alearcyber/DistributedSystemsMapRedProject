NEG a montage prologue quite obviously manufactured by the blessed maniacs who actually chose to distribute this thing tries to convince us that the comic impact of this staggeringly incompetent bit of nothing is entirely deliberate dont you believe it this is to lloyd kaufman as andy warhol is to herschel gordon lewis it is so thoroughgoing in its project of torturing its hypothetical audience that it seems like some kind of misanthropic negationist art installation only it cant be because it is so completely bereft of selfconsciousness as obnoxious and ugly as things or frozen scream this manages to up the ante by recycling itself with a maddeningly bald insistence that has to be seen to be believed a hitchcockstyle shotbyshot analysis of say the attack on the cardio girls might yield twenty edits and perhaps three minutes of footage  only the sequence is ten minutes long you want to believe that this started life as a slightly more bearable short subject except if you took away the repetition whats left would be far less fascinating eg when the fiend does enter the room he only inspires extended highly apathetic utterly blank stares from his imminent offscreen victims repeat this scenario about four times in marginally varied settings bridge these with perhaps thirty lines of dialogue total offer up actors even more hateful and lethargic than those in the above mentioned classics and grace us with a monster comprising gauze ketchup and one yellow spock ear and youve got a movie too mindboggling to refuse a working definition of bad im proud to own it
