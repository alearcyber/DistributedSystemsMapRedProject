POS when people harp on about how they dont make em like they used to then just point them towards this fantastically entertaining and quaintlooking comedy horror from writerdirector glenn mcquaidbr br its a tale of graverobbers played by dominic monaghan and larry fessenden who end up digging up more than just silent immobile corpses after the initial shock of this they soon realise that they can actually turn the situation to their advantage and thats just what they try to do mind you it seems as if things may not have worked out quite as they planned as poor young arthur monaghan is actually relating his tale to a priest ron perlman before being taken to the gallowsbr br looking at the detail of his filmography mcquaid seems to have taken the core of his first short movie and expanded it to this feature effort which is no bad thing fessenden returns and does well monaghan is one of those guys who can actually still get you to like him while he goes about the nefarious business of stealing from the dead and with other genre favourites such as perlman and angus scrimm on the scene this film is a lot of fun for genre fansbr br it also benefits from a unique and favourable design and look at times moving from ec comicstyle panels into live action a la creepshow and always somehow feeling quite authentic in its hammer horror feel maybe everything is just covered over with so much dry ice but thats beside the point whatever was done to capture everything on film it works it works wellbr br it may not have any actual scares but this film does have a great vein of black humour and definitely soaks every minute of its runtime in macabre material that should please all of those who have the patience for horror thats a little bit more sedate and feels like it definitely could have been made back in the days of hammerbr br see this if you like the flesh and the fiends the doctor and the devils creepshow
