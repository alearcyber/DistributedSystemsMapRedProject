POS probably the best comedy in a long time keeps you laughing nonstop the acting is good and there are a lot of hilarious cameos such as ben stiller as the guitar store guy the plot wasnt as good as i had hoped but the comedy makes up for that i can only hope for a sequel cause it seems like they can still do so much more even though it was  hour and  minutes long i still wanted more at the end  also there is a scene after the credits which is actually one of my favorite parts of the movie i suggest this to anyone who loves a good comedy and definitely suggest it to fans of the d or jack black you should buy the album also the songs are so damn catchy and hilarious the music on it is top notch as well
