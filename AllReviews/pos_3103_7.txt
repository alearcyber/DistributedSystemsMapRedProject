POS the film begins with a cranky old broadway producer exceptionally wellplayed by veteran character actor richard carle being driven by a man hoping to sell him a story for an upcoming play however there is a bad storm and their car becomes stuck in the mud and so they are forced to look for some place to spend the night fortunately theres a mansion nearby though it seems pretty odd that the people inside know the writer and he says he didnt realize this was the home of a man he knew and despised however while this seems like bad and contrived writing it is notas this is all part of an elaborate ruse by the writer to have a group of actors in the home act out his plot however partway through the ruse the producer and his browbeaten assistant figure out that the murder mystery taking place in the home is fake and think the whole affair is pretty funny what no one realizes though is that an escaped maniac is loose and he is about to enter this contrived little plotmaking for some wonderful twists and turns so when it seems that there is a real murder the actors are truly terrified while carle and his sidekick are convinced its all a hoax while i have explained some of the plot there are many more aspects of the film youll just have to figure out yourselfand its surely to keep you entertained and guessingbr br considering that this is a bmovie in the public domain i certainly did not have very high hopes for this little film however i was thrilled when the film turned out to be a much better than average flickwith a very interesting and novel twist on the old clichd plot about a dark and stormy night spent in a mansion plus while the plotting of the film was very good the dialog was even betterwith lots of sparkling wit and a nice lighthearted pace full of pleasant surprises and well worth your time
