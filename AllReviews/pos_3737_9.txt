POS i think this show was right on the money for me i watched it over the plane but there were parts in the movie that made me control myself from tearing all over the place br br the chemistry between richard gere and diane lane was very believable fantastic acting on both parts i loved how diane lanes daughter acted in the show too she displayed maturity and how she transformed throughout the show was easy to believe as what a teenager could possibly be like in real life br br i loved this show from start to end definitely recommended for the romantic people out there
