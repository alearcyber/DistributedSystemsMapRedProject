NEG with this film being directed by roger avery and quentin tarantino doing the screenplay i was sure this was going to be a gem i was wrong i dont hate this film but in no ways do i like itbr br i love roger avery because of his amazing direction in rules of attraction and his screenplays to pulp fiction and silent hill but he made a mistake making this do i really need to comment on tarantino we all know hes a geniusbr br this movie is just set around a gang robbing a bank but fails due to silly people participating in the robberybr br im disappointed in tarantino and avery for doing this film but doesnt change my mind on how amazing they both are everyone makes mistakes jd seaton
