NEG as an avid gone with the wind fan i was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters luckily the film on its own was a wonderful piece when the book scarlett came out i read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters farther on their journey together while the book lacks any true quality it remains a good story and as long as i was able to separate it from the original was and still is enjoyable however i consider the six hours i spent watching the scarlett miniseries to be some of the worstspent hours of my life discrediting any of the original character traits so wellformed in margaret mitchells book this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape mistrust murder and misformed relationships that even the book scarlett stayed away from the casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so wellformed in both the original novel and film and even carried through in the second book and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character in the novel scarlett ohara butler follows her estranged husband rhett butler to charleston under the guise of visiting extended family after coming to an arrangement with rhett she agrees to leave and proceeds to reconnect with her ohara relatives in savannah eventually she accompanies her cousin colum a passionate leader of the fenian brotherhood to ireland to further explore her familys roots that go deep and is eventually named the ohara the head of the family while her duties as the ohara keep her engaged in her town of ballyhara scarlett ventures out into the world of the english landowners and instantly becomes a soughtafter guest at many of their parties she having been scorned by rhett time and time again eventually agrees to marry luke the earl of fenton until rhett comes along in a clichd nightonwhitehorse  type of a rescue the scarlett miniseries fails even to do this justice raped by her fianc and scorned by her family the series shows scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committedbr br i heartily advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to rethink this decision
