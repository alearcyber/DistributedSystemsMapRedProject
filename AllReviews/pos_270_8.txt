POS as the superb prime suspect series reaches part four there is no loss of momentum at all this in itself a considerable achievement prime suspect iv the lost child has the solid supporting cast that we take for granted in these british dramas but of course the beautiful helen mirren easily dominates our eyes never leave her while shes onscreenbr br the search for the lost child of the title leads superintendent jane tennisons cid team to a prime suspect who turns out to be a convicted pedophile now living with a single mother and her two young daughters the insight we are given into the workings of his mind is one of the emotional highlights of this miniseries but it may be too strong for many stomachsbr br the action sequences are brilliantly handled with the handheld camera thrusting us right into the middle of the excitement and theres gripping tension during the climactic siegebr br altogether this is another magnificent police procedural drama
