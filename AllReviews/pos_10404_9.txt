POS being a great fan of horror especially asian horror i have seen tons of movies but this one is outstanding why it does have a plot which is unfortunately quite rare among horror movies the actors did a good job it feels like a real documentary film even if its not it does not get boring for a moment the director cleverly combines the plot with the acts of a certain japanese magic cult perhaps this cult never existed but still its believable it reminded me of the similarly great movie forbidden sirenbr br to me the one and only annoying thing about the movie was the character hori the psychic but this is subjectivebr br i recommend this movie to all fans of quality horrorbr br  out of
