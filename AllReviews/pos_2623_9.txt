POS having seen only once and in the dawn hours i cant seem to forget this haunting film a mix of mystery suspense and heartbreaking romance it reminds me of vertigothe actors though not that well known are good especially joan hackett in one of her best performancesyou believe in her in her lovein her newfound quest for freedom brought by her love and in the end in her overwhelming painthe plot is ingenious and compelling and does not stretch credibility the direction and technical stuff certainly could be better but they do not compromise the overall effect and it has one message dont let revenge blind you you can became its last victima real pity it has not been remade but perhaps it is a period piece better left alone
