POS i saw the movie at the nashville film festival on may   it was amazing all the things that i had read about stuey were portrayed incredibly well by tony vidmer writer director producer editor michael imperioli incredible job as stuey and all the others involved in this im glad he vidmer didnt go down the leaving las vegas routine with stueys bad habits but instead put us inside his life family and his gift tying the whole story from the motel room where he died was a great vehicle and showed his screenwriting skill a big thumbs up on this one
