NEG there are other reviews here expressing similar views but i still feel impelled to add my comments the film is generally wellmade from a technical point of view apart from possibly being too long the acting is mostly very good although kevin spacey isnt given much space to explain his characters motivation apparently ambition rather than racism and sandra bullocks only function seems to be as eye candy which she admittedly manages very wellbr br at a fundamental level the films heart is in the right place in being opposed to racism and i get the impression that it tried to set out to be some kind of definitive treatment of racism perhaps why so many famous names agreed to be in it however it seems the writers bit off far more than they could chew i havent read the book so i dont know how much of that is down to grisham the biggest problem as many others have said is that it ends up advocating vigilante justice aside from the fact that i dont agree with that position i dont think that such a view actually helps the antiracist cause at all  its more likely to be applied to acquit white defendants who kill black victims at the end the prosecutor invites the jury and the audience to imagine that the raped girl was white  but follow that through and imagine the defendant to be a white man who murdered black rapists  in the end the message seems to be that its ok to kill someone as long as you hate them enough its also convenient that the man killed was presented as totally evil and his guilt was in no doubt which removes any of the moral ambiguity likely in a real casebr br samuel l jackson gives an excellent performance but unfortunately this also undermines the plot  he comes across as someone with considerable integrity but its hard to believe that he would be willing to hide behind an insanity plea and indeed he doesnt when push comes to shove were presumably supposed to think that its because he faces the death penalty but in fact at one point hes offered a plea of manslaughter although if you blink you might miss it why not take it given that he must know his chances of acquittal are slim or if he wants to make a stand in court why plead insanitybr br there are less serious flaws too the medical experts on whose testimony the case supposedly rests are jokes  both are discredited for highly implausible reasons and neither of them offers any real psychiatric diagnosis the message seems to be that expert witnesses will say whatever theyre asked to say and shouldnt be believed the fact that the injured policeman supports jackson is moderately plausible but still a bit convenient and what if he had died i find it hard to believe that the kkk would march down the street in broad daylight other apparently serious crimes riot arson kidnapping attempted murder go by without any visible attempt to detect or prosecute them and the scene where the dog comes bounding back is ludicrousbr br my final reaction is to be left feeling rather dirty  as though i must be a racist because i disagree with the resolution it may be that the film intended to explore different viewpoints and leave the audience to decide but if so they seem to have forgotten it by the time they got to the end the film did make me think about my views read what other people thought here and add my own opinion so at some level maybe it succeeded  but i worry that it may have reinforced highly illiberal views in some people which i hope is the opposite of what it intendedbr br final thought  try watching law and order it covers issues like this with much more depth in about  minutes of screen time
