POS this was my late wifes favorite film im sorry she did not live long enough to have the video as im sure she would have worn it out what can we say a great romantic story and the push off of two great men the raisuli and teddy rex sean connery and brian keith are great in these roles but while connery is his usual sexy sex its the late brian keith who gives us a solid performance as the mercurial teddy roosevelt back up is provided with candy bergen gorgeous in her early s as the kidnapped american widow great backup also comes from the great john huston as teddys beleaguered secstate john hay geoffrey lewis from the clint eastwood films is great as the hesitant us ambassador gummere the late vladek sheybal with his demonically evil stare is great as the beshaw and more is given by steve kanaly and roy jensen whose faces we have seen in several backgrounds all in all this is a film filled with wonderful romance mindful of an era long gone mindless story not at all the issue of big nations pushing around smaller ones for their own hegemonical interests is as true today as it was then overly romantic not really certainly not maudlin in any sense fun to watch you bet i own the video and will watch it again and again i suggest you do the same
