POS ed coincidentally an editor is hired to cut horror films down to be favorable in europe where standards are much more rigorous but he finds the films very minddestroying and starts going a little bit mad okay a little bit might be an understatementbr br let me just say this first of all best opening scene ever a man in an office who blows up his head with a grenade his boss then says  with a straight face  youre fired the entire film does not keep up this level of intensity but it certainly triesbr br take the shotgun scenes the decapitation the clips from lost limbs which my friend jason wishes were a real film the writer of this film thought up the idea of a woman who gets raped by a beaver and then immediately after gets shot in the face with a bazooka that is something you wont find in any other movie at least im pretty doubtful you willbr br this films biggest flaw is the quality the picture isnt as crisp as a  film should be and the sound could be touched up though its not bad i thought i was watching a s film although that gave it a bit of a boost in my mind  the film also had the s style of writing and directing in it a sense of fun and giving the audience a little something extra over the top i do miss those daysbr br i wish i had more to say though at the moment i cannot think of anything strong enough to praise this film i do think you ought to see this youve seen the box in your video store with the ax splitting the head maybe youve passed it up a few times maybe you thought it would be cheesy pick it up savor it
