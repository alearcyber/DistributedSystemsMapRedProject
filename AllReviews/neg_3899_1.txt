NEG i know jesse franco is responsible for a wide variety of films and i mainly go for his horror films as lousy as they are at times i guess it was morbid curiousity that drew me to this and i wasnt even curious enough to finish it maybe it got better towards the end but unless youre into lesbian sex scenes of which theres plenty then you may want to take a pass so what exactly can you say about a movie that features a woman that pees in a bowl on the kitchen counter while standing up just never you mind what thats used for later you probably dont want to know if this sounds intriguing to you then thats your problem but then again you might just like this movie i myself am no prude ive seen plenty of disgusting movies in my day but at least they were done well and this isnt sometimes too much is just too much bleah
