POS on seeing this movie i didnt expect much i was delightfully surprised although the writing was unpolished as some of the dialog seemed drawnout and contrived the script did have shining moments my favorite line life is like a rich meringue anand im diabetic so i cant enjoy it the plot was new and refreshing as opposed to some of the newer more mainstream horror that most of us are sadly growing used to i do believe some of the scenes could should have been longer and maybe some shorter the superfluous use of blood was campy but seemed to make sense in the endah the end the end would have been a little better if they had explained why what happened happened i dont wanna spoil it it might have also added to the movie time which is in the area of its only an hour long how good could it be answer quite good
