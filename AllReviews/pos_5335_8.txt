POS arising from characters previously developed in a series of muchlauded shorts the curse of the wererabbit is about as far from runofthemill family fare as you can get beautifully crafted and with witty dialogue and clever concepts this really is a movie that will appeal to almost every member of the familybr br the story concerns wallace and his dog gromit who live in a village obsessed with growing large vegetables for the annual fair and who operate antipesto a humane solution to all those pesky rabbits that torment passionate gardeners everywhere the business is a great successbut wallace proves a bit too clever for his own good when he tries to rehabilitate rabbits from their vegetablecrunching ways he unexpectedly unleashes an ancient horror of legendary proportions the wererabbit and suddenly no vegetable in town is safe the movie is full of crazy inventions unexpectedly smart dialogue and references to everything from king kong to the wolf manmore than enough to entice even a jaded teenagerbut the real charm of the thing is in its characters the amount of personality the artists and animators can wring from bits of clay is amazing they seem as fully alive as any fleshandblood actor the dvd release and i recommend the widescreen includes a number of informative and entertaining extras as well greatly recommended gft amazon reviewer
