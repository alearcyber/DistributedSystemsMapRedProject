POS i didnt really think this movie was bad sure the detective kinda sucked at what he did and he usually happened upon capt howdy by accident but he got the job done capt howdy himself was pretty scary the makeup artist did a great job i really liked seeing dee dressed up all geeky i laughed so hard when i saw that i personally dont see how someone can sit through crap like texas chainsaw massacre and call it a great movie and then watch strangeland which is more disturbing because a lot of it could actually happen with the internet being so popular and call it bad i personally think that texas chainsaw massacre was loads of crap probably one of the stupidest movies that ive ever seen i enjoyed strangeland it was a very disturbing movie because almost all of it actually happens
