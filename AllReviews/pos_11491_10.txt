POS this is a truly great and beautiful movie the underlying theme of this movie is the innocent child heather graham as joline struggling to make her naive wishes for how the world should be make sense while being incessantly beaten down by the real world its not an unhappy movie though  exactly the opposite its a funny movie with a sad side but just thinking about the movie makes me feel so happy near the beginning of the movie beautiful vulnerable joline confronts a drug addict attempting to break into her friends car she reasons with him convinces him to seek help and gives him  as a start at the end of the movie he reappears to pay her back explains that he is off drugs doing well and he thanks her i can hear the cynics groaning of course that would never really happen this movie doesnt take place in the real world it takes place in the world we wished we lived in the sad part is realizing we dont live there the happy part is knowing there are people wishing we did
