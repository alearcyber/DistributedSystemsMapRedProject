NEG take your video camera turn out all the lights in your house and film people running around with flashlights for an hour and a half and youve got the basic idea of what this film looks like it is very irritating to watch this kind of movie to be fair there are scenes of daylight at the very beginning and very end of the movie i like scary movies and creature features but this one just didnt do a thing for me so sorry i really tried to like it there didnt seem to be much of a plot other than weve got to find a way out of here didnt learn too much about any of the characters so it didnt matter if we lost one or two along the way this isnt the worst movie in the world open water holds that title for now
