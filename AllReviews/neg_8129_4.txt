NEG big and we mean plus sized big baddie sebastian cabot is trying to run salt of the earth farmers off their land in order to get the oil rights when sea faring sterling hadens pop is killed how will haden put an end to terror in a texas town armed only with a harpoon br br first off this isnt a bwestern there are no singing cowboys no daredevil stunts no interesting action sequences its just an independent movie  you know the ones that use unimportant actors to say important things and cover the general low budget vapidity of the goings on with interesting camera anglesbr br second this movie to avoid compromises one expects that would cause the elimination of trumbos important statements about justice in america and the rather sick relationship between the chief henchman and his girl is really low budget the main problem that causes is that the acting is really really bad sterling haden is decent enough in tough roles but he is the last guy you want playing a sensitive swedish sailor gone to find his fortune in the west sebastian cabot tries to do a sydney greenstreet as very bloated plutocrat its not a bad idea but cabot does not have the acting chops for it the guy who plays the hired gun with the missing arm and soul johnny crale has the best role in the film he does nothing with itbr br third the script really isnt all that trumbo gets some digs in about the immigrant isnt going to get a fair shake from the sheriff in a corrupt town and the people when up against real oppression tend to back down this is a pretty stale movie message by   high noon bad day at black rock devils doorway  are all westerns that deal with the evils of western society with an eye to the evils of s america trumbo in  certainly had every personal reason to agree with those sentiments but he isnt doing anything new or interesting with thembr br so given all the negatives why does this movie get a  mostly because there are interesting quirks throughout the movie the relationship between crale and his girl is um fascinating and trumbo while a mediocre writer when pursuing his political affectations is very good in creating both interesting characters and intelligent interactions between them just when one is ready to pass out from indy movie boredom will come an exchange of dialog or simple quirkiness that gets one realize that guy writing the script was not simply a hackbr br if you dont like trumbo or westerns give this one a miss otherwise try it you might like it more than i did
