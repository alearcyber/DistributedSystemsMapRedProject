POS set in hungary in november  this is the story of a group of foreign nationals who were trying to leave the country at the time of the uprisingbr br once the airport is closed the titular journey begins on a bus taking them to austria as would be obvious they are stopped on their way which is where they come up against the almost faultless yul brynner whose military power as a red army major was marked with loneliness his internal struggle between right and wrong his search for the truth and his need to feel emotions for other human beings he was saddened by the fact that his job had alienated him from his friends and enemies alike and he yearned for social contactbr br robert morley plays the quintessential stiff upperlipped englishman who no matter how serious the role manages to maintain an almost lighthearted logical outlook on life while jason robards has a stunning movie debut which enforces the reason why he had so many roles throughout his career deborah kerr as the leading lady exhibits the grace and femininity we have come to associate with her yet manages to bring over the strength and resolve required for her characterbr br the film deals with a very tempestuous time in european history but it never ceases to remind us that there is good in all of us and you can never completely judge a book by the cover fabulous scriptwriting ensures that for all the seriousness of the subject there can still be great oneliners and comedic instances that add to rather than detract from the movie the chemistry in the cat and mouse game between kerr and brynner makes you understand why they appeared in more than the one film togetherbr br all in all a thoroughly engrossing movie which i would definitely watch again
