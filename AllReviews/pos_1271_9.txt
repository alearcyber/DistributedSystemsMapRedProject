POS brit director chrstopher nolan now has a career in america and a reputation for making movies both popular and critically acclaimed but this small film was where he started and it certainly showcased his talent with its striking blackandwhite cinematography and achronological storytelling that prefigures his later momento albeit in a less extreme way thematically and mechanistically the plot reminded me of david mamets house of games but the film still feels fresh and sharp right up to the final twist of the ending whose flavour was expected but whose pointedness is unexpectedly delicious the acting on the other hand is not quite in the same class  the film has a stylised quality and possibly to a greater extent than the director intended but its still a fine debut simultaneously claustrophobic and beguiling
