NEG admittedly the only reason i watched this film  since its been about a decade since it was released  was because of ian holm i was intrigued to see his portrayal of my secondfavorite character in this play at any rate this film is as gritty as anything the old zeff has produced since jesus of nazareth but some of the best parts of the play have been left out i understand the directingediting choices but i dont think that it really does justice to the play perhaps im too much a purist i would have to direct people who have read this far toward branaghs version if it werent that i despise his tendency toward overdramatization all the same he plays a better hamlet than gibson but then werent we all waiting for gibson to prove himself as an actor now all hes done is to prove that he wants to make films in extinct languagesbr br perhaps the only shakespeareanworthy acting here is scofield as the ghost
