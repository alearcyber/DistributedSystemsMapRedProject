POS dan dailey gives a sincere and colorful performance as the great dizzy dean his handling of the character is very true to life and captures the flavor of deans background and limited education the film of course centers around dizzy deans rise to fame and his sudden trip to the sidelines with an injury he chose to ignore much to his regret his wife is splendidly portrayed by joanna dru who gives a very down to earth quality to the woman who loved and supported the ballplayer who rose to a dizzying height so quickly the portrayal of dizzys later career as a sportscaster is honest and unflinching reflecting his troubles which stemmed from his poor education and his colorful language both on and off the air dizzy was quite a character and daily has breathed life into his story with admirable skill if you enjoyed this film i recommend the comedy kid from left field  wherein daily plays a down and out hasbeen ballplayer idolized by his young son billy chapin daily again fleshes out a ballplayer in a completely satisfying manner i heartily recommend pride of st louis to baseball fans everywhere
