NEG ive had never been disappointed by a kurosawa film but this is probably the first doppelganger is the worst ive seen from this directorbr br tartan films is advertising this as the most frightening film yet from kiyoshi kurosawa what the most frightening film from kurosawa is definitely kairo and if you think this is horror your in for a surprise this cant be classified as horror or thriller this is a drama and a pretty bad one at that a lot of scenes that were meant to be shocking have turned out being funny and a lot of the plot is really confusing and since its kurosawa the pacing is slow but its so slow that youll lose interest forty minutes in and feel like doing something else the thing that annoyed me the most was the use of cgi now cgi if used well can be really cool but if executed with little care it can be a disaster i think that describes one scene here that has a very minimal use of cgibr br the only positive thing i can give dopppelganger is that it has really good acting koji yakusho gives a great performance along with the rest of the cast but thats pretty much itbr br please do yourself a favor and go watch kairo or korei if you want to be scared this is a bad bad attempt at a smart drama which it is intelligent but well theres a lot missingbr br  for the good acting
