NEG a man is builing a hotel with a partner he finds out the hotel is overinsured things just get worse this film has a huge mumber of scenes they must have been put together in someones sleep it jumps around from place to place it does not stay focused on anything for very long the ending starts on christmas morning with a hotel fire it then cuts to a night scene of that fire and then cuts back to day time the dvd sound track is horrible it takes a fair plot and turns into the worst film i have scene in a long time
