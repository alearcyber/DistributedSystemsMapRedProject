NEG does anyone care about any of the characters in this film  or for that matter what happens to them  i doubt it that is the key problem  for a tragedy to work we have to care about at least one of the characters and none of them inspire any sympathy or appear to have any redeeming qualities at allbr br what may have worked in the th century certainly does not work in one can only assume post apocalyptic liverpool if that was indeed what it was meant to be the problem is the characters in post apocalyptic liverpool whilst still driving around in cars using mobile phones and watching television have reverted to speaking in shakespearian language  with a liverpudlian dialect oh dear bad enough you might think  but this often lapsed into pure scouse  with comments such as eh lah are you a cockney and was that a merseyrail announcement during one of the scenes filmed in the underground well the good news is that in post apocalyptic liverpool  the trains are still runningbr br the characters without exception are badly drawn wooden and more like charicatures on the lines of the jokerpenguin in batman and robin except there is no real storyline to speak of  or if there is  it is one that doesnt work in a modern setting where half the sets are gloomy and blade runnerish and the other half are fluorescent garish or just st century normal costumes are also mixed up with half wearing their everyday clothes parkers are big in post apocalyptic liverpool  apparently and the other half wearing costumes from the leftovers of a fancy dress partybr br the film explores the ideas of lust incest and revenge in the most inane fashion imaginable  the tragedy is that this film was made at allbr br
