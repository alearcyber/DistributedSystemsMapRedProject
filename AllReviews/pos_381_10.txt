POS looking back at the career of alfred hitchcock it never fails to be surprising how such a brilliant and visionary man could be denied sufficient recognition for how revolutionary he was for the film industry it is likely a sign of how ahead of his time hitchcock was always attempting to push the envelope and never coasting along with a film made simply for the purpose of being entertaining but always with a deeper more poignant motive on his mind strangers on a train one of hitchcocks first and more underrated hits is a perfect example of these traits  an entertaining and suspenseful story even when viewed over  years later yes but so carefully and intelligently constructed it stands today as a masterpiece in film technique br br arguably one of the pioneering suspense thrillers strangers on a train may come across as slightly dated in certain aspects but it retains every bit of superbly crafted tension as it did back in  if perhaps slightly less shocking the brilliant use of cinematography and lighting as well as quick careful editing are what really make the film stand out drawing out every possible iota of tension and retaining the audiences focus even in slower scenes if there was ever any doubt of what a simply masterful filmmaker hitchcock was simply watching five minutes of strangers on a train should be enough to disavow such sentiments every shot is so carefully chosen and constructed all serving to drive the storyline ahead in a particularly innovative fashion sadly enough there are certain moments in the story which are screechingly out of place enough to jar our focus away from the superb cinematography and editing  bruno being able to reach down to the bottom of a sewer grate is simply unbelievable and the figure of a stereotypical old man crawling under a wildly out of control carousel provides unintentional comedic relief in what is meant to be the films most tense and engaging scene these are only brief moments but they are enough to stand out as painfully weak in an otherwise stellar filmbr br but what really makes strangers on a train stand out is the story premise as hollywood films of late run the risk of descending inescapably further and further into the vat of turgid cliche after cliche its wonderfully refreshing to see a  year old film with a premise which actually comes across as smart and original sure its fairly straightforward but the concept of swapping murders is simply one that would not fly in films of todays day and age which makes it all the more entertaining to watch the films brilliant screenplay keeps the action flowing at a swift pace while providing us with some wonderfully memorable lines all the while one cant help but notice the deeper themes hitchcock is alluding to throughout as well especially the concept of darkness in humanitys heart demonstrated by elderly ladies being fascinated and exhilarated by the prospect of murder as well as brunos own cavalier attitude towards death hitch also works in many moments of dark humour bruno popping a childs balloon with his cigarette is priceless and irony shooting suspenseful scenes in happy easygoing environments such as the iconic carnival scenes to create an even more eerie atmosphere this may be a suspense thriller yes but to overlook the brain concealed beneath it would be simply inexcusable br br the antagonistic figure of bruno essayed to perverse perfection by robert walker sadly in his last film role but easily stealing the film from his admittably very talented fellow cast members is without a doubt what makes strangers on a train so memorable as the character is a marvel to behold here we have a simply superbly crafted villainous figure all the more intriguing by how ordinary and unassuming he seems rather than cackling madly and thwarting the hero at every possible moment bruno is a calm controlled psychotic mess he speaks of murder in such an offhand tone yet retains a passionate glint in his eye when discussing different fashions of killing people bruno could seem to represent the id as freud would put it the inner darker and uninhibited aspects of mankind it makes an interesting contrast to the hero figure guy haines and how bland and uninteresting he seems almost as if to drive home the prospect of evil being much more interesting and appealing than constantly striving to do the right thing br br yet despite this implied message hitch still twists our emotions enough that we root for guy at every turn and cheer at each new obstacle he is forced to overcome its a testament to actor farley grangers talent that despite robert walkers villain easily stealing the show grangers hero still comes across as sympathetic still commanding our support even when falling prey to being a far less compelling character superb support is given by ruth roman who manages to overcome the cliche and be a more innovative and complex romantic interest figure kasey rogers giving a stunning performance as guys horrifyingly manipulative and hedonistic first wife and patricia hitchcock proving that she is far more talented than being simply the directors daughter would imply the superb cast headed by a simply wonderful walker really bring the film to life adding so much more merit to the film than simply hitchcocks breathtaking stylistics br br all in all strangers on a train may still come across as slightly too dated for certain viewers but its still a shock how modern and appealing to contemporary audiences seems considering it was released half a century ago once again hitchcock proves his unparalleled mastery of tension and film technique and the films surprisingly original and enjoyable premise is alone worth a viewing highly recommended to anyone wishing to undertake a brilliantly made but superbly entertaining film experience br br
