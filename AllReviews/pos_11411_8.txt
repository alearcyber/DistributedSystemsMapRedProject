POS the movie is about a girl whos not going to a bonfire only because shes babysitting that night nothing weird about that right until  the phone rings until  the phone rings again and again  and again those are not some stupid prank calls this is for real if you wanna see how the girl reacts just watch the moviebr br great atmosphere filled with scary sounds very well performed by young camilla belle who got the lead role i see in her some great potential to become a good actress this is more than only a decent thriller i have no idea why its so underrated anyway on my opinion this movie deserves more than only   of all voters rated the movie with  get serious people you couldnt get a better thriller for a title like this
