NEG you would probably get something like this im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence of course there are stupid hollywood movies about drunken teenagers on a spring break but those movies dont even claim to be serious works of art but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say  its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things br br one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much i wish someone told the director that its kind of ridiculous even in an unrealistic art movie to portray a slavic woman as a halfarticulate dishevelled creature connected to the forces of nature probably due to the fact that she had spent her entire childhood looking at the stars and milking cows on a threelegged stool
