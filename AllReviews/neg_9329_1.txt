NEG this movie was childish in its writing and laughable in its visual effects scenes where father merrin is tossing in his bed and his glimpses of a gimpy native are signs of bad acting and poor imagination nothing seems to fit the story jumps from scene to scene the elementary writing leaves no fact to the imagination and leaves no room for suspense the lady doctor at one point states that she thinks the town is going to explode soon from all the crazy happenings there was in fact nothing in the movie to make that line relevant from the terrible job the movie had done i would have never known that there were any tensions in the village if you are into cheesy movies go ahead and rent this but if you want to see this done right check out exorcistthe beginning
