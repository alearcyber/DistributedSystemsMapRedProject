NEG i saw the trailers of this movie and found the cinematography and what was presented interesting i saw the imdb rating and  confirmed it to be an above average movie thus went to see itbr br the story is about mandy lane amber heard  a beautiful girl in high school who is a subject of male sexual desire mandys friend emmets michael welch provocation to another fellow student to show his love for mandy leaves the fellow student drunk and jump down to death nine months pass and mandy is invited for a summer weekend to a secluded ranch by her teenager friends  three girls and three boys go there there is a security guard garth anson mount who works at the ranch during the first night itself the killings take place  one by one the members of the group are killed who is behind the killings i wont tell here to spoil sports did i like the movie no after usual interesting opening  the movie takes a downward turn with every unfolding of event by halftime when the killer is revealed one looses all interest in the remaining proceedings there is a last twist in the tale to shock viewers but rather it made me shake the head in disbelief and laugh all this for suspense huh amber heard acts and plays her role well as a shy and conscious girl  who is aware of her beauty and mens desire for her the remaining cast are usual  nothing to say about there are so many movies made of teenager boys and girls going to a secluded place and slowly someone killing them one by one  that it does not interest me anymorebr br director jonathan levine tries hard to make the movie interesting by using contemporary chat talks of teenagers loaded with sexual overtones but does not allow the movie to rise above the mundanebr br the only and the most appealing saving grace of the movie is its cinematography by darren genet  who captures beautiful picture perfect images stars  out of
