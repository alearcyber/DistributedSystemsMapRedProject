NEG in the early s stepbystep came as a tedious combination of the ultracheesy full house and the longdefunct loopy classic hit the brady bunch the differences between stepbystep and the two aforementioned shows was of course better writing excellent comedic timing from almost all of its actors and a great deal funnier situations that werent quite as sugarcoated as its extremely popular predecessors admittedly though even with the big boosts in the shows basic dynamics and all it still wasnt exactly spectacular nor was it really even that memorable in the long line of corny family programming it was just a much better timepasser you might say in comparison to the cutesy migraineinducing full house which coincidentally ran neckandneck with stepbystep during that time period in terms of overall popularity the show now in syndication obviously is certainly suitable familyfare but be sure to not expect much beyond that when watching it
