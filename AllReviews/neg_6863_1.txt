NEG i would be one of the few people who owns a copy of this classic but i dont only own  i actually own  its that goodbr br well when i say good i mean bad but i will try to do a thorough review i even watched born a ninja which one of the other reviewers here mentioned to compare it to this and born a ninja is actually worse but not quite as funnybr br and is this ever funny everything about this movie is poor everything the plot is absolutely stuffed note the youll need to keep me alive if you want to know where to find your wife every action sequence is stuffed too our hero danton is more than a hero he can stab people with twigs take  bullets in the heart at  cm away without even bleeding and tie a rope up to a tree which when an enemy steps on it ties a knot around the enemies leg picks him up and throws him  metres into a bunch of spikesbr br the acting is so bad it is impossible to comment on it but it should have you rolling especially dantons jump out of the ground and growl at the bad guy oh yes and the bad guys somehow it seems they resurrect themselves  times each in the movie perhaps its just that there werent enough actors but in a movie of this calibre i doubt thatbr br the plot is about how danton was a soldier in the vietnam war and now his colonel is hunting real people for training for his mercenaries the colonel just happens to pick up danton then danton fights back this is just the excuse for a rambo clone with most of the movie being danton slaughtering soldiers and i really cant explain the plot any more cos there is nothing else to the movie it still rocks thoughbr br what else could be wrong you ask dont get me started hand grenades which actually go off at the actors feet because the explosion is the size of a matchscenes where there are  people chasing danton then the camera cuts away and back and there are  the way that every time danton loads the grenade launcher he is against the same background even though he is in completely diffrent locations and the worst part is when danton pushes the plastic boulders onto the enemies and one enemy is completely untouched by the boulders so he doesnt know what to do so he half heartedly dies without even being touched its ridiculousbr br but funny very very funny this is one of the few movies i can thoroughly recommend to everybody cos if you dont find it funny you are  in a million and for the rest of us its magic
