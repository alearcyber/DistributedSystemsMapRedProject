POS not being a movie aficionado i am not familiar with the names of leading directors scriptwriters producers and the like but i can tell an outstanding movie when i see onebr br the makers of this fine movie could well be now at the top of their fields or may well get there pretty soon i know that the actors are already therebr br it takes talent closer to genius to show with such realism how a national tragedy like vietnam has impacted the everyday life of a typically average american family and make us see at close range why there are so many homeless vietnam veteransbr br without getting into gratuitous scenes of gore and bloodshed it makes us understand why so many youg men had flashbacks of what they had been thrubr br the dialog is particularly gripping and gives us an idea of what went on in so many families in the aftermath of vietnambr br i wish there were more good movies like this one not just about vietnam but about other social conditions as well
