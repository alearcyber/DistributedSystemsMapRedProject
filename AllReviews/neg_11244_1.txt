NEG i just watched this movie last night within  minutes of the start i was hoping it would endbr br it had a promising beginning the first  minutes the premise of this movie friendship that goes nowhere after theyve spent days and years together in separate beds in hotel rooms is just not believable he does kiss her somewhere along the way and she feels ohh so terrible about it br br very little substance to grab your interest the acting just does not hold up he is very passive regardless of how much of the movie is shown the viewer never develops any type of a caring connection with the characters on the screen you learn that her next utterance will be as boring as her previous one do you have a cigarette  he doesnt smoke he wants her to stop smoking doesnt she know this by nowbr br she calls him in the middle of the night to visit him after a years absence she comes in through the door they dont even hug or kiss or express any type of emotional connection he doesnt even lean forward to lift her suitcase to help her in that is not how real people behave this is not how best pals behavebr br when he receives her phone call in the middle of the night she is in town for one day he shows little interest to see her face acts more like she will be a burden for the night at this point theyve known each other for two years and he hasnt seen her for a year not believable not real br br supposedly he has written a book on entropy and enthalpy yet we never see him write or read or discuss any of his interests in physics with her not that she would be able to handle the discussion we learn that a watermelon in la costs  it wasnt the silicon type mind you he has no problem affording that fruit we also learn that the airport shuts down when a few really really fake snow flakes fall off the sky im sorry but was that in la toobr br we never see how these two characters survive we never see them at work we never see them struggle they are always on vacation they have infinite time they have no worries whatsoever br br nice life unreal life unreal characters bad title bad movie
