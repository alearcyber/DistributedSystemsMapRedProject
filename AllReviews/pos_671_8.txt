POS beware my lovely came on tv on bbc recently during the early hours so i set the video to record it and was pleased i didbr br a man finds a dead woman so he escapes so he dont get the blame for her murder and gets a job as a handyman at a widows house but she does not know what she is taking on here it turns out this man is a psychopath and possible killer he starts tormenting her and locks her in the cellar he then cuts the phones line so she cant get help from the outside a young boy who regularly does shopping for her notices something isnt quite right when he comes to drop her shopping off eventually the man leaves acting as if nothing has happenedbr br i can see why beware my lovely was given an x certificate when released in the cinemas some of the scenes are rather nasty for this time i also thought the man was going to do something to the young boy toobr br the cast features an excellent performance from robert ryan as the psychopath ida lupino as the widow and are joined by barbara whiting and dee pollock as the boybr br this is certainly robert ryans most chilling performance ive seen a must seebr br rating  stars out of
