NEG while its one of two movies on tales of voodoo volume  theres no voodoo or anything supernatural in it the box labels it hell hole but the screen title is escape from hell hole the title is confusingly similar to hell hole  aka escape from womens hell hole a group of women bathe in a river and seemingly the worst thing they have to worry about is a peeping tom who they easily overpower no nudity in this or any other scene howeverbr br a woman named cardena drives up in a car and seems to be known and liked by all the women she invites indri to come and live in the city with her and her uncle mg once they get there it becomes clear that mg wants to take indris virginity mg runs some sort of house of prostitution and hes either in charge of a corrupt branch of the military or runs a paramilitary outfit or prefers for his guards to all wear militarystyle uniformsbr br the women who refuse him or otherwise make trouble get put into a prison indri gets sent there the women get tortured and sometimes possibly raped by the guardsbr br various unsuccessful attempts at escape or rescue are made but inevitably fail despite the obvious advantages the women have they outnumber the guards vastly and relatively few of the guards have automatic weapons  most have semiautomatic rifles or handgunsbr br wip genre enthusiasts may like it and the fact that it was made in the philippines gives it some novelty but otherwise eh
