NEG alexandra ripley wrote a horrible sequel to margaret mitchells masterpiece book published in the s margaret mitchells heirs sold out their rights and for big bucks allowed alexandra ripley to write a piece of junk book even worse than barbara cortland romance novels i was a huge fan of margaret mitchells book and the fake sequel by alexandra ripley was written just to cash in for moneybr br although i always admired the acting talent of joanne kilmer and timothy dalton this is a really terrible film the script is horrible and full of clichs ann margarets cameo as belle watling is so awful i wanted to slap herbr br the only worthwhile thing in the movie is sean bean who gives a masterful bravura performance as the sexy feral villain  lord fenton sean beans performance is along the lines of the man you love to hate and portrays an unsafe sex symbolbr br but sean bean is only in the first half of the movie so you then have to be tormented with watching an incredibly long  hour movie with an insufferably boring scriptbr br dont waste your money on this film unless you are a hard core sean bean fan and just watch it for his wonderful performance
