NEG no matter what other people have said you cant review this movie without comparing it to the original if it existed on its own it would be a  out of  film but it is a remake of a  out of  film and so has standards to live up to and we need to see if it reached those standards if the film was a reworking or as in planet of the apes a reimagining of the original you would be able to look at the film in its own right only referencing the original imagine it this way if someone took the model in the mona lisa posed her in a different way and painted her you could only compare the framingconcept etc to the original but if someone just repainted her in the position of the original you would have to compare it totallybr br that said this film doesnt just fail to be as good as the original it fails spectacularly like it or not the original was one of the best movies ever made the shower scene will never be forgotten the remake was meant to be a celebration of hitchcock but ended up actually degrading him and his master workbr br the degrading aspects of this picture were vince vaughn and anne heche its nothing to do with wether they acted better or not its that the relationship between norman and marion in the original was really quite innocent norman didnt really understand sex he had hardly any contact with the outside world and when he meets beautiful marion and watches her change you feel that he is partly doing it from fascination as he doesnt really understand sex and his attraction to herthis makes norman sympathetic and almost an antihero you are on his side because he doesnt fully understand the world and is constantly fighting with himself and his mother in the remake that whole dynamic is gone i must admit to janet leigh not being my type but she is very attractive and you can see that anne heche is really unattractive and so norman finding her marion attractive is unbelievable if you add that to vince vaughns norman masturbating whilst looking at her and you get a norman that is just waiting for a chance to jack off at any naked woman no matter what she looks like who you feel absolutely no sympathy for they further destroy normans innocent nature by putting the porno mags in his room it destroys a character that we have come to like and feel sorry for its like remaking its a wonderful life and having the main character a pimp totally degradingbr br the only other character that i had problems with was rita wilson as caroline marions workmate in the original when pat hitchcock says the line he must have noticed my wedding ring it elicits a response of laughter as she is absolutely kidding herself when rita says it it just seems plausible as there really isnt any other reason why any man would flirt with anne heche over herbr br ill admit that i am very biased the original psycho is my favorite film of all time had the film been a reworking with a different angle then you could have turned these characters on their heads and it would have been perfectly acceptablebr br hitch famously thaught the film would be too gory in colour and made it in black and white to lessen it this also made the film more atmospheric and frightening in its own way and it gave it a beauty that could never be captured in colour and it is a sad statement about how movies are desensetising the public that people have said how the shower scene was more frightening in colour nb before people think he cant spell remember im from england and we spell it colourbr br a remake should be just that re made this is a forgery a complete copy and a very bad one at that i could go on comparing but there is no point almost everything is superior in the original the only one thing that is better is the performance of viggo mortensen as sam loomis john gavin was very flat in the original hitch called him the stiff behind his back and mortensen gives a more believable if less likeable performance william h macy and julianne moore are the only other actors that hold up to the originalsbr br overall a movie that should be labeled expensive embarrassing failed experiment only view if comparing to original or if original is unknown to you but view original too the movie would have got a  out of  if it were original or a reworking but as it is  out of  for macy moore and mortensen
