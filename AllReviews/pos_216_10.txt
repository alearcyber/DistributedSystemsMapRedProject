POS the inspiration for the naked gun movies casts leslie nielsen  who had only recently started doing comedy  as the incompetent but heroic frank drebin always having to solve an absurd case like airplane and the movies based on the series the humor relies on mel brooksstyle spot gags and silly comments namely the yes it is remarks along with the fact that nielsen remains very serious despite the nonsense around him and of course the final frame in which something keeps movingbr br its too bad that the show only had six episodes at least it spawned the movies you cant go wrong with leslie nielsen in these sorts of roles i suspect that they all had fun filming it really funnybr br before airplane leslie nielsen had starred in movies like forbidden planet harlow and the poseidon adventure as late as  he costarred in nuts alongside barbra streisand and richard dreyfuss but since the first naked gun movie its been all comedy all the time
