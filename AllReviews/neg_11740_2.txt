NEG spoilers includedbr br alfred hitchcocks brilliant and innovative adaptation of robert blochs novel was an amazing film unlike anything previous every shot every camera angle every nuance was perfect he didnt just break the rules he made up a whole set of new onesbr br heres the spoiler there is absolutely nothing new different or original about this movie gus van sant doesnt just pay a homage to hitch he rips off every idea and does so in a less original more conventional manner i didnt have anything against gus van sant before i saw this movie i liked drugstore cowboy and i thought my own private idaho was a very interesting film the question burning in my mind when it comes to the remake of psycho is why did you do it gusbr br in my mind there are only two reasons to do a remake  the original was a good story but the movie sucked  the original was a good movie but someone has thought of a fresh new approach to the material neither one of these factors is at all present in the gus van sant version of psycho apart from the fact that it is in color and there is one scene in which there is a montage of disturbing imagery relating to the title characters possible inner dialogue which i found unnecessary there is nothing new herebr br furthermore i found the casting left something to be desired anne heche was okay as marion but she lacked a certain vulnerability that janet leigh portrayed in the original i didnt feel as sympathetic towards her character because the choices she faced seemed far less constrained as a woman in todays society as opposed to the choices she would have faced as a single woman living in the early s vince vaughn got a few laughs with his rendering of an incredibly naive norman bates but i feel that anthony perkins timing and nervous haunted look was much more effectively creepy the only performance that i enjoyed better than the original was the character of lila crane played by jullianne moore she was excellent as usual and brought a new strength and intelligence to the characterbr br to be fair there is some beautiful camera work especially during the famous bathroom scene in which van sant takes advantage of his use of color to show the murder in vibrant shades of crimson and yet during the whole film i had this irritating sense of deju vu havent i seen this somewhere before oh wait i have seen this somewhere before nearly every scene seems to be copied shot for shot from the original one almost gets the feeling the director made this film as a school project see i can make a hitchcock film toobr br if you havent already go see the original its held up over the years and beats this bit of mediocrity hands down you wont be disappointed
