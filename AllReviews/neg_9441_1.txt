NEG this film has absolutely no redeeming features its not even worthy of being in the so bad its good category  its simply bad badly acted badly shot badly written badly directed terrible sound recording and the whole thing is just incredibly amateur quite how this got a release is beyond mebr br oh and could someone please tell the lead actress that if youre playing mad that does not mean that you should constantly fiddle with your hair  in a film that was generally irritating this was probably one of the most irritating things of allbr br on the plus side i think this is the only film ever to feature a nazi carjacker
