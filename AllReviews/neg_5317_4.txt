NEG blindingly stupid guff from the formerly talented john hughes wholl soon be making a film with the sperm from look whos talking if his stars get any younger he recycles the home alone formula yet again to produce this idiotic comedy in which a baby makes his way around chicago while inept kidnappers joe mantegna joe pantoliano and brian haley try to catch him along the way enduring much tiresome slapstick if mantegna and pantoliano cant find a laugh somewhere in your movie then youre in trouble but the laziness of the movie is most glaring in the scenes where crowds of people fail to notice a baby crawling around on the pavement utter nonsense
