POS if youve not seen this then look out for it it is available on dvd it is a channel  uk production possibly in conjunction with german and danish tv if youve seen the film it is basically the same plot several interleaved stories are connected through the drugs trade the story jumps between the housewife played by the excellent lyndsay duncan trying to complete a deal on behalf of her husband who to her surprise is an international drugs dealer and generally dangerous manbr br a minister who is embedded in his job to the detriment of his family is investigating the whole state of affairs with international drugs trafficking he gets a few eye openers to the reality of heroin when his daughter turns out to have a problem he then visit pakistan officially where he seems to be taught that the abuse not simply the drug or its casual use is the problem and also gets to sample some produce an excellent scene where he simultaneously realises what the attraction is and why it is and why it is such a problem in pakistan we get to see the other side the desperation of farmers who can barely survive turning to opium production and crime lords the pointless attempts at subsidy resulting in the system getting rich and a country so drenched in drugs yet only a relative fraction of the abuse we have in the west around all this a customs officialinterpol agent tries to catch the dutch connection in heroin smuggling seeking justice for his murdered partner this really is a masterpiece super understated performances from all the main actors in a way only european cinema can really dobr br a must see especially if you have seen the film they compliment each other abd present some subtly different opinionsattitudes from both sides of the pond
