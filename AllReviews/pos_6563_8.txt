POS wow i just saw this movie on the sundance channel and it really is bizarre i may not be a film expert but its probably the most bizarre film i as an average movie fan have seenbr br whoever came up with with it had a great imagination im a bit of a fan of japanese dramas and there are often actors from dramas in movies matsushima nanako for example the lead in ringu is a major jdrama star but it looks like this is the first film for kirie and shuichis portrayers i must say if they really are debuting here they do a pretty good jobbr br kirie was a very sympathetic character i thought she was easy to relate with she was kind and goodhearted perhaps not the most popular girl but nicer than some of the other attentionseeking girls she was also pretty in a classic kind of way i hope she does more films but its been a couple years so maybe she has no such plansbr br the ending was odd im not going to give anything away but the rest of the movies bizarreness was kind of put to shamebr br very bizarre but very imaginative and unique movie id recommend it for japanese horror fans though ill warn you its a lot more bizarre than ringubr br nonetheless id give it a  out of  for originality imagination good characterization above average acting and just being plain intriguing
