NEG well shuck me sideways i havent seen a home movie this bad since the abysmal  seconds or half caste someone should take away this guys sony handycam this movie proves that just because you can make a movie on your camcorder for  doesnt necessarily mean you shouldbr br i remember that one of the things that robert rodriguez wrote in his book rebel without a crew was that when you set out to make a no budget feature you have to use whatever assets you have at your disposal rodriguez says that you should take an inventory of all the locations and props that you can beg steal and borrow from your friends robert rodriquez was friends with the mayor of some town in mexico so the mayor let him shoot all over for free what you got in el mariachi was a movie that looked like it cost much more than the actual budgetbr br im sure that the director of this movie has a copy of that book and he took that advice to heart in this case he was apparently friends with a guy who owned a cornfield where they put on a haunted house every year seems like a pretty good location for a scary movie but its hard to keep a cornfield interesting for  minutes not a single installment of the children of the corn series spent more than a few minutes in the cornfield hitchcock only spent about ten minutes in one in north by northwest take a hint fella cornfields dont make for riveting cinema it would have been good if the director would have had more friends with more locations because this thing gets pretty tedious after the first  minutes this movie looks like it cost about  or whatever it cost in admission to the cornfield mazebr br apparently he couldnt even find anyone to act in his movie so he cast himself big mistake heres a thought if you really want to make a movie get an actor so as far as assets go it seems like the cornfield maze is the only thing the poor guy had maybe he thought that was enough in fact im going to go out on a limb and say that i know he thought that was enough because the movie before it captured the coveted honor of being the sequel to dark harvest was called simply the maize the movie maybe this hes already planning the maize the musical or even the maize the miniseriesbr br our jackofalltrades and yes the master of nothing part of that saying is definitely appropriate here plays a psychic dad who can tell when bad things are going to happen think of the character from the dead zone but not anywhere near as good an actor as christopher walken or even anthony michael hall psychic dad has a premonition that his two daughters who are at the corn maze with mom are going to be killed he rushes to save them from that point on the whole movie is spent watching pyschic dad run around in a cornfield looking for his two daughters he finds the two little girl ghosts from the shining and he helps solve the mystery of their murderbr br shot on a  handycam the director cast himself edited on imovie improvised story if thats not enough to keep you away from this amaizeingly corny catastrophe consider this as a final warning the whole movie takes place in a cornfield boils and ghouls heres ghoulie gurus tip on how to save some money and still feel like youve seen this movie next time you see a cornfield stop the car take a flashlight and go run around in there for like  minutes
