NEG ive come to realise through watching this sort of film that i dont like them very much caged women is yet another women in prison film and like the most of the rest of the genre the plot is completely forsaken in favour of simply showing nude women now dont get me wrong i love nude women but i also like there to be some sort of plot thread to go with the nudity and since this film has only the basic women are in prison theme running through it aswell as the essential escape of course i got a bit bored before the end the film is good because theres barely a moment in it where the women are wearing clothes but thats about the only positive element director and writer ha ha erwin c dietrich delights in showing closeups of the naked female body but its never very erotic the director was the producer on a number of trash flicks including some directed by jess franco in my opinion he should stick to producing as his writing talents are nonexistent and he doesnt seem to know how to film a sex scene this sort of material is rather dry a lot of the time but i reckon franco could have made more out of it overall this might suffice for people that are really into this sort of stuff but i cant say i enjoyed it
