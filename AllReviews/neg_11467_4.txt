NEG i just went to see this movie with a friend i quickly looked and read a short synopsis and thought it sounded interesting we came out the movies not feeling very sure if we liked it notbr br the acting was good enough and connection with characters was ok the main character i thought acted a lot like someone like van helsing yes it was pretty entertainingbr br but the plot i felt like it was used from other movies the script was a bit weak im not sure why every time something bad happens the main character says oh my god every timebr br the special effects worked well but sorry for this spoiler the main monster at the main climax reminded me a lot of the balrok out of lord of the ringsbr br overall the movie was ok but i felt like its been done already go and see buy all means but dont expect too much
