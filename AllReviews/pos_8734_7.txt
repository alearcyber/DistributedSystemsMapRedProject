POS when i saw lauren bacall do cactus flower on broadway i never dreamed that one day i would see an actress like ingrid bergman playing the bacall role on screen but here ingrid really lets her hair down for some good comedy moments as the dental nurse pretending to be walter matthaus wife so he can go on with the fib hes told goldie hawnbr br its a story played for laughs from beginning to end goodhumored stuff that never runs out of dry humor and wit throughout its running time there are plenty of oneliners or gags that are way above the usual situation comedy stuff one hears on tvthe lines ring true because they blend so well with the characters and their motivesbr br as the daffy girl who contemplates in the beginning committing suicide over her unhappy affair with matthau goldie hawn fresh from her days as a star on tvs laugh in does a dumb blonde role to perfection easy to see why she won that supporting actress oscarbr br ingrid is surprisingly fetching in a rare comedy role although there are times when she seems just a bit too matronly for the part at any rate shes a surprising choice to play the nurse who puts on a freeze act at the office but is considerably warmer off dutybr br as goldies next door neighbor igor rick lenz acquits himself admirably and makes a suitable match for her in that final scenebr br matthau plays the kind of character that became his stock in trade in all those neil simon roles he hada lovable cad who gets caught up in his own messes when he tells lie after liebr br its the kind of ribtickling comedy thatll have you laughing out loud at some of the amusing lines that abe burrows and ial diamond have managed to scrap together based on a french farce
