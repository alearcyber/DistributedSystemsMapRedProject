NEG tdy is probably the single worst piece of trash to ever hit the straight to video selection they take a scene from the order starring jean claude van damme and this angers me because van damme is a personally favourite for b movie comedy segal has done some fine work in the past but he has dropped very low in my books and he will probably never pull out another undersiege or marked for death unless he sits down and has a very good brain storming session with himself br br it also annoys me how he didnt do many of his own stunts like he has done in previous films in conclusion of all this if you are prepared to see a movie fit for a trash can or woodchipper then rent today you die
