POS we just saw this film previewed before release at the norfolk va film forum and there was general agreement on two matters there were excellent performances in a first rate drama by the two leads and by others and secondly the marketing for this movie will only bring disaster we saw a lurid poster with chains and suggestive commentary implying some sort of wacko sexual relationship between samuel jackson and cristina ricci whereas the movie has some real depth and some thoughtful ideas whats sad is that people looking for near porn will be drawn in to see the film and will be disappointed because it will be too heavy for them while the people who would really enjoy it wouldnt be caught dead walking into the theater showing it too bad a good film wasted
