NEG emraan hashmi post murder did some good roles in bhatt films but other director just made use of his kissing and naughty imagebr br aksar is one of them and it came after aaa jawani diwani in a row and i was already fed up of him and such roles br br the film has a nice twist at the start i felt like an abbas mustan film but then it turns into a routine film with sudden love sudden jealousy and a bad climaxbr br anant mahadevan makes a terrible film music is saving grace camerawork is fabulousbr br emraan hashmi just repeats his act of his earlier films and has  expressions throughout dino looks stiff talks as if he is practicing hindi and does okay in some scenes udita is expressionless and irritates
