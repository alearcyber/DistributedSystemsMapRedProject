NEG problem child was an okay movie but did it really merit a sequel i dont think it did the original movies only redeeming asset was gilbert gottfried and he wasnt even good in this sequelbr br i cant really put my finger on why this movie was bad for starters it just wasnt funny even when i saw this as a nineyearold i didnt sympathize with junior michael oliver at all his character came off to me as whiny selfloathing and perhaps most importantly a rebel without a clue he appeared to hate every woman that his father ben john ritter dated for the sole sake of hating them it also doesnt send a good message to kids with divorced parents who constitute over half children in the us these days when the one woman ben decides to almost marry is a southern aristocrat who is vindictive and who happens to hate children as it isbr br and as cool as i thought it would have been to see original snl cast mate laraine newman come back to the big screen she couldnt even save this movie i also found it strange that she was a white southern dbutante whose name was lawanda that sounds more like an africanamerican womans name but of course that has nothing to do with why i disliked this moviebr br i think the movie didnt work because you had antagonists you were supposed to hate along with protagonists you werent supposed to hate john ritters character was supposed to be a good parent who tried desperately to teach his child right from wrong without conforming to authoritative parenting instead he came off not only as a wimpy parent but also one who was desperate to find a wife in a matter of days regardless of how well he knew the woman did i mention this sends a bad message to children of divorced parentsbr br in a nutshell the rest of the things that went wrong with this movie included amy yasbeck unnecessary and unexplained return to play an entirely different character that young girl who was even more obnoxious than junior completely uncalled for toilet humor and even more outrageous and outdated homophobic humor involving the dog catchers the movie was just a mess and really doesnt deserve a dvd release if it hasnt been given one already it should just rot on vhs along with all the other bad forgettable s comedies
