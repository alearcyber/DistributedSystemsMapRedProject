POS as it turns out chris farley and david spade only made three movies together coneheads tommy boy and black sheep but this was truly the citizen kane of their pairings farley plays thomas callahan iii the dimwitted heir to an auto parts company his father big tom brian dennehy hires mildmannered richard hayden david spade to look after him big tom is getting married to a ten bo derek so everything has to be in order after big tom suddenly dies tommy and richard have to try to sell half a million auto parts to save the company from bankruptcy from then on the movie is pretty much an excuse for chris farley to do what he does best make a mess of everythingbr br when this movie first came out in the theaters i saw it with my grandfather he figured out early on that the bo derek and rob lowe characters were hiding something but you can completely ignore that and simply luxuriate in chris farleys antics nothing is safe around his stomach and hell hath no fury like his happygolucky attitude the scene where he sets the cars on fire and later the deer scene make for a pure laugh riot chris farley and david spade were truly the john belushi and dan aykroyd of their era its a pleasure to always be able to think about fat guy in a little coat time and again
