NEG this was one of the most dishonest meaningless and nonpeaceful of the films i have ever seen the representation of the other of the israelis was racist backward and unfair for one the song played on es car radio when pulled up alongside a very rightwing israeli driver was i put a spell on you by natacha atlas the songs style is quite arabic but it was released on an israeli compilation cd and i have even heard it on the radio in israel many israeli songs as well as architecture foods and slang are influenced by arabic culture and there is no reason an israeli jew would be offended or angered by a nearby car playing that song the way es appears so calm and collected with his sunglasses and cool glare via a long still shot is meant to force the viewer into seeing the jew as haggard and racist and es as noble and temperatebr br i have traveled all over israel and i have never seen an idf recruitment poster since service is mandatory but in the film not only is there a recruitment poster but it depicts a stereotypical image of an arab terrorist and the words want to shoot this is an extremely inaccurate depiction of the mentality of the majority of israelis as well as israeli soldiers and such an advertisement wouldnt even exist on a random israeli highway in including it the director aims to convince the audience that israel is a society of antiarab racists hellbent on murderbr br the ninja scene was gratuitous and needlessly violent a hollywoodstyle action scene involving israeli soldiers shooting palestinians would be just as unwelcome in an israelidirected film as the ninja scene should have been but for some reason images of an unrealistic noncomic and violent scenario manage to elicit applause from the audience since the director has smeared the israeli side so much beforehand that any shot of israeli soldiers being killed would be welcome the director shows absolutely no attempt at building bridges portraying the other as human or working towards peace violence is made to be the only solution this is furthered by scenes of exploding tanks falling guard towers and other random acts of destruction one of my best friends serves in the israeli military and the targets in firing ranges are never arab women dressed in black or any other quasicivilian on canvas soldiers at checkpoints are instructed not to fire at the head of an approaching palestinian unless it is clear that their own lives are in danger the method according to my friend is to provide a warning shout fire into the air or around the area and then if all else fails shoot in the leg and then interrogate and hospitalize arbitrarily targeting a woman in the head as shown in the film is not the proper procedurebr br besides these inaccuracies the directing style was also poor repetition became repetitious and no longer captivating symbols such as the balloon with arafat drawn on it are forced outside any plot structure or effective integration in the setting the balloon is palestine penetrating and regaining jerusalem and it is created for no reason by es the ambulance being checked for permits by israeli soldiers followed by subsequent israeli ambulances flying past the checkpoint is an overlyovert claim of an israeli double standard by the director the attempt by the director to show life in nazareth as dreary and pointless is done with overkill showing the routines of random people over and over again even with a slight change each time and emphasizing that not one member of the cast ever smiles and is minimalist in dialogue almost screams out the purpose of such scenes the dreariness of life without allowing much room for personal interpretation by contrasting one section of the movie daily life in nazareth with the second section the checkpoint between ramallah and israel the director subtly blames this dreariness on israel but never provides any direct evidence as to why such blame can be properly arguedbr br i spent hours trying to figure out why music ended abruptly and began abruptly and why many modern fashionshowlike and metalaction tracks were included in the score i still cannot come up with an answer i felt that the music was out of place in this film the contrast between more silent scenes and intense scenes was actually annoying and not affecting or thoughtprovoking i can understand if the director intended for the music to provide some comic aspect to certain scenes but i found that there was nothing comic to be found in israeli soldiers shooting at targets or fighting a ninja or a woman having to suffer another walk through a checkpoint albeit defiantly in fact i was tempted to close my ears during intense scenes and annoyed by the lack of a score during quiet scenes whatever the directors intent it provided only an audial displeasure throughout the filmbr br this film has no legitimate political message because it provides an inaccurate and extreme representation of the other and neglects to actually address any issues it is a propaganda film because the director intends various symbols styles and scenes to draw sympathy for the palestinian side while displaying the israeli side as cruel and inhuman without exception the vibrant atmosphere of an actionpacked hollywood scene or of intense music is displayed in every act of violence by palestinians against israelis such that the almost inevitably positive and thrilled feelings the music and cinematography elicit from the audience are directed to one side there is no thought reflection or deepening of the understanding of the conflict by the audience emotions are simply pulled to one side and kept there in a good vs bad clich scenario i believe this film lacked the depth quality and power of other palestinian films such as paradise now and wedding in the galilee
