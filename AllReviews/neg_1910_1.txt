NEG i had been waiting eagerly to see this movie but when i finally got the chance i was very disappointed i had to stop halfway or was it quarterway because of the poor script and directing not to mention the poor cast josh hartnett is the only one who can act and hes much more suitable to be the hero of the storybr br well basically the story is just about a loose girl from the country who cheated on her longtime decent boyfriend only to have meaningless sex with a spoiled rich brat this movie failed to draw my sympathy not even when the writer intended to i wonder where the moral values gobr br the actors are so stiff that when i resume the movie few weeks after it was interrupted due to its boring nature they still failed to make me pay attention the spoiled couple can only disgust me what a moviebr br i think all the people involved in this production need to sit down and review it together so that they wont make the same mistakes next time round and next time they might consider josh hartnett as the protagonist
