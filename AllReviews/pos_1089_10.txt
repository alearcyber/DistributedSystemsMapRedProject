POS i love the way he experiments ab tak chappan was a thrill to watch just as much satya and company was jatin the new comer also lived up to his role and nana patekar was at his best suchak was really irritating but i think he fit the character he was playing  he had really ugly teeth the story has a great progress and no songs in the movie makes it better i only wish he signs up urmila for his other up coming movies i think they are the best director and actress combination i have seen i have not seen naach as yet but i am looking forward for it i for some reason dont find antra maali that exciting to watch on the screen  unlike urmila
