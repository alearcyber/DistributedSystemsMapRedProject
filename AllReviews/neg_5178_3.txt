NEG this movie could have been great it is not in my opinion the storyline is fragmented the editor appears not to be able to choose between a guy ritchiestyle of storytelling and a more straightforward one there is a great emphasis on excessive violence including torture too much so if you ask me the characters are very shallow and stereotyped i would have liked to see more depth there it is hard to identify with the main character as a result the movie remains shallow as a wholebr br the movie says it gives the spectator an inside view of the british criminal underclass more in particular the essex underclass footballhooligans steroids cocaine heroine and violence lots and lots of violence violence resulting from paranoia and fear in general in this movie noone seems to use his or her brain were looking at a bunch of animals in clothes like i said there is not much of a plot and the storytelling leaves a lot to be desired br br if youre a male below  like gore and hardcore violence and think thats entertaining than this is a movie for you if youre looking for a movie portraying real people with a well developed storyline suspense and depth well you can skip this one
