NEG master plan have the winning team in a deadly tournament one of several martial arts action pictures that attempted to capture the flavor of the famous enter the dragon from  this one is an effort from south africa the villains stronghold is a bit different appearing as a white castlelike fortress in the middle of the desert from a distance the villain himself a baron or general is a slightly more perverse version of the drno or han mold of master villainy having strange flashbacks to the glory days of nazi germany he does wear the full regalia nazi uniform at some points his main ambition in life is to hold an illegal martial arts competitiontournament against his japanese rival an extension of their complicity in the nd world war my army is better than your army it sounds silly and it is though the suggestion of madness and crazed machismo almost works the central hero steve chase ryan resembles a white bruce lee character having a similarly lean lithe physique though obviously not on the same level of martial arts expertise i thought he would be some secret government agent here but apparently not he and his girlfriend have joined the barons team of fighters but decide to quit what did they think they were getting into of course its not that easy theres an odd sequence of them escaping through the desert using a wrecked car with a rigged sail  those desert winds can do wonders for travel it seemsbr br the plot kind of meanders in the nd half as the hero joins the team of the villains competitor and the girlfriend is held hostage by the villain in a cell under threat of rape by the heros rival the most interesting character turns out to be chico a dwarf who is the villains assistant hes loyal to the baron but is sympathetic to the plight of the hero much of the fighting utilizes the balletlike capabilities of the hero with a lot of leaping and slow motion the sound fx are also amped up and exaggerated in an attempt to add more impact to the blows there are a few good fights during the tournament towards the climax but none really stand out if one had to pick i suppose the best involves the brutish muscle manhenchman of the baron introduced late in the story he lifts the back of a car at one point you wonder how the hero will take him out at the end since the brute seems to shrug off most of the punches the acting is very mediocre descending into camp as far as the girlfriend who tends to laugh for no reason as if shes high on grass though she is very cute some of the training scenes are also campy especially all those guys running over or rolling down the desert sands and with such a title theres surprisingly few actual killings ryan as steve chase returned as a traditional agent in the sequel kill and kill again hero villain femme fatales henchmen fights stuntschases gadgets auto locations pace overall
