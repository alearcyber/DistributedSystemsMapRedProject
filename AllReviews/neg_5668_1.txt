NEG first off i just want to say that this show couldve done well way better than its doing now what brought it down was certainly the acting miranda cosgrove who acts as the main character carly looked almost worthy of her own show when she was on drake and josh unfortunately icarly was a big let down not only can miranda not act convincingly enough but shes incredibly stiff when she moves she looks as if shes not sure how the character carly would move or stand in the very first episode at the end when she throws the hat up her arm doesnt ever leave her side from her elbow up even when she was dancing she looked like a stick in the breeze and the singing the theme song was great only because drake had been in it the music was pretty good and mirandas voice sounded fake i have to admit the plot and settings are good unrealistic but hey thats nick theyre practically known for stupid lines and characters but wow is icarly the worst of them all
