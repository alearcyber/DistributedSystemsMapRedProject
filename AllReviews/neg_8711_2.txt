NEG the only reason i am giving a second star is for the first half of the movie this was a good rendition of the story i enjoy seeing a few fictional characters added to add some color to a well known story but the second half was horrible yes there were violent aspects of this story but the writers of this movie chose to only include the violence and forget about the good things god did for the israelites towards the end of the movie scott looked as though he were getting messages from the big giant head instead of talking and hearing from god this rendition had some huge problems with deviation from scripture and big surprise there are no favorable deviations their portrayal of moses as this screaming naked lunatic who did all of this against his will is totally false it showed a moses who had to scream in order to get god to talk to him wrong the scripture says god spoke to moses all the time and not just after a temper tantrum they got the peoples complaining right but failed to show that god spoke to moses at sinai in an audible voice that the followers could hear and believechapter  they also forgot the pillar of fire and cloud which guided them in the day and nightbr br what was the whole joshua thing the righteous peace loving jew who would not fight until moses threatens him wrong he was known as a great warrior what about the great speech that moses gave the army telling them god had helped them enough and now they were on their own wrong they only won through gods help as shown in their own scenes with moses lifting his staffand what was that sorry looking ark of the covenant instead of overlaying it with gold this movie was on a tight budget and attached little gold chips to it oh yeah it was a molten calf not a straw one with little chips tacked on someone forgot that they came out of egypt with a huge amount of gold tribute from the egyptians you wouldnt know it from this sorry looking bunchbr br by the way the part about them slaying the israelites after the golden calf incident says men and does not mention women and children which the movie delighted in showing the viewers oh yeah  manna wasnt the only thing sent from heaven  dont forget the birds for meat also the bible mentions jethro bringing moses his wife and children and then says jethro went back to his own land it does not say that moses gave up his familybr br oh well if you know nothing about the real story read exodus for yourself if you know the real story you will hate this version
