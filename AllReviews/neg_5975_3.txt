NEG when exploiters become evangelist they still exploit in the name of poverty br br my first reaction after seeing the movie is  god bless me that i am not eating fish or any nonvegetarian products br br the documentary is about lake victoria of tanzania where numerous varieties of lovely fishes used to live and one day during s somebody came and injected the mighty fish perch who became the exportable commodity for tanzania to european and japanese markets the consequences were severe  firstly all local small and big fish were extinct secondly the plane that came to take the fish could not travel empty because it does not make commercial business capitalist sense so it is filled with arms and ammunition that is what europe can give this world thirdly the pilots as all migrants and traveling population like truck drivers has to survive their sexual needs by flourishing cheap local african prostitutes for them fourthly the brokers dealers middle men in the chain mainly indian origin business people get richer and tanzanias poverty remains the same fifth poverty drives the children to crime drugs etcbr br the premise to make this documentary was excellent but has the director hubert sauper succeeded in making a good documentary it is a big no br br i say the reasons like in india it requires a higher caste brahmin to stand up and project to the world indian poverty and untouchables similarly it requires an austrain born european documentary maker to tell the world the story of tanzania and its crumbling and ruining economy and poverty it is the pathetic motive of unaware breeding of that rich class who have never seen poverty or known poor who survives live earn and fame like pest hanging on to projecting poverty to the world as soon as they see it there is nothing more but despise by poor people in african and india who see such images of theirbr br the intention and motives of the hubert seems totally lopsided the images characters locales interviews are too grave and murky dark and disturbing he uses exaggerated ignorance as a voice to present his case what we feel in the end is pity and sadness for africans we also start considering the tanzania government and people as villainous may be some westerners sitting in their airconditioned rooms would find time to discuss and debate about the pathetic living conditions of africans but there would be nothing more than thatbr br the director restrains to show himself even once on the screen  so as not to be identified among the europeans who exploit this poor countrybr br this director hubert can only survive being exploiters themselves like todays cnn and bcc media giants hubert did not have guts or common sense to talk to any europeans who eat or companies who import these fish products a totally lopsided flimsy effort but i understand the reasons of the same  hubert just wanted to rake his fame sitting and smiling with awards in his european comfortbr br no more words to spare for this pathetic effort i hesitantly give the documentary a higher rating  stars out of  just because the theme was correct but was pathetically exploited and blown away by amateurish ill conceived director made solely for unintelligent western audiences stars  out of
