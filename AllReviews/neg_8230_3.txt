NEG this is an odd movie on the surface its no different to many other dgrade gore movies but in at least a few ways it stands out firstly the main killer character is really weird how the heck a guy who only ever clucks like a chicken got paroled is totally beyond me what was that female parole board member thinking hes totally reformed and rehabilitated he clucks another problem with luther the geek is the scriptdirection for the women the daughter is so pathetic and seemingly stupid that if she was mine ild slap her in attempting to untie her mother off the bed she struggles with knots and just doesnt seem to think ill get scissors or a knife later on in a similar attempt to untie her mother she wanders down stairs and starts searching in a box of scrapbooking stuff for some scissors eventually she gets a knife by the way this is after the killer has obviously left in the car and just returned bizarre on the plus side the daughter did get her kit off for the shower scene so that was nice although again unusual it seems that in many of these dgrade gore movies they happily show throats being bitten open with gushing blood but the sight of a female breast is somehow too strong for the audience in general it worked but it was annoying and nasty although the bare breasts made up for some of that
