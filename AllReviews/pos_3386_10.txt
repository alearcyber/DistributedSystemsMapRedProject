POS i first saw this miniseries as a child and though i am a child no longer i still love it professional copies are hard to find however when its on dvd its mine br br great casting marvellous plots and plenty of action romance and even quite a bit of wellplaced comedy im not a historian by nature but i love this masterpiece of historical fiction
