NEG eh its not really as good as the other dragonballs the villains are actually ripoffs of other z villains like cell frieza and even majin buu with baby being friezas clone super  being cells clone and the shadow dragons being buus clones the story is also very bad as it deals with goku shrinking shrinking it deals with him shrinking to like the size of an eight year old just to get it going let us not forget how weak the characters become gohan cant go mystic anymore and is even weaker than panits sad i know speaking of pan she was so cute at the end of z now shes lost all that cuteness and become an irritatingwhiny little girl whose sole purpose in this series is to get in the way goten doesnt even have a purpose in the series and trunks well i dont know what to say about trunks gt is just an attempt to milk the popular dragonball franchise if you really like dragonball then avoid this series it doesnt even feel like dragonball i will be fair though as the ending however was really good and is actually pretty sad at least to me and the theme songs both ending and opening are better japanese not american mightve been better if toriyama san worked on it
