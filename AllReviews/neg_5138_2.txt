NEG forgettable pilot that never really explains why nostradamus is really important to the plot of this movie but rob estes plays a a hunky cop who happens to be nostradamus for some reason and who battles timetravelling medieval monks that run around with guns and set people on fire to start the apocalypse oh yeah theres also a sexy fbi agent who happens to be a pyschic and is trying to get rob to believe everything before its too late too bad they couldnt predict a better plot yawnbr br
