NEG and also a wonderful beginning a real quick start it keeps you yearning and waiting for is about to come unfortunately the high adrenaline dries off quickly but most certainly after half the movie is overbr br and its a shame because this movie has really good ideas and explores many of them thoroughly but that is also one of its faults by exploring too many things it gets mixed up into to many things so in the end youre too confused to follow any plot or characters its very dark and moody but that doesnt help much if its also genre hopping just to try to fit any and everything in its story
