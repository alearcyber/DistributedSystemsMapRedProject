NEG during the s several attempts have been made to revive old matsumotos series yoshinobu nishizaki tried to revive old yamato saga in form of a laughably bad yamato  which was completely abandoned after mere two episodes captain harlock suffered a confusing and pointless harlock saga while galaxy express  suffered having this hack of a movie stapled to its namebr br if youve seen queen millennia youll recall that it was a wonderful movie in its own way maetel legend tries to tell a sequel to this already concluded chapter also finding a way to suck at doing sobr br this movie takes all the annoying aspects of a generic pulp science fiction movie mixes it with badly paced melodrama and to add an insult to an injury tosses in some of the most renowned characters from matsumotos universebr br the only redeeming aspect of this movie is good artwork but the remainder is so amazingly bad that it cant save this movie from being a total lossbr br if youve enjoyed queen millennia or galaxy express do yourself a favor and skip this hack of a movie youll thank me
