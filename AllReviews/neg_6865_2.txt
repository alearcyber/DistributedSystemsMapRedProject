NEG i cant believe im wasting my time with a comment  but this movie is weirdly bad if  different directors were brought in to film different parts of the movie without having any idea of the storyline being filmed by the other directors this is pretty much the result i would expectbr br i also think some of the scenes were spliced out of order  things dont always seem to progress in order the movie acts like were already supposed to know about half the charactersbr br and steve guttenberg tries to do manic alarobin williams comedy in this movie ewww and the whole premise of putting an excon in charge of a bunch of kids just doesnt seem realistic in this day and age
