NEG before last call w carson daly my local nbc affiliate aired much more worthwhile programming after late night w conan such as second city tv rd rock from the sun  carline in the city reruns and some stand up comedy these days there is nothing worthwhile to watch because all i get to see is carson daly and his awful show he is not a comedian he is not an actor he does not deserve to be famous because he isnt a good speaker nor comedianbr br on his june st show he tried to use an internet meme called the rickroll on his show he failed hard that event confirms that carson daly is awful
