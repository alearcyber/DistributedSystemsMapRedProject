NEG most movies i can sit through easily even if i do not particularly like the movie i am the type of person who recognizes great films even if i do not like the genre this is the first movie i could not stand to watch cat in the hat is the worst movie i have ever seenand ive seen a lot of movies the acting is okay myers is good as the cat its just that he is really annoying the silly songs the cat sings were boring and monotonous even for the children in the audience the plot drags on and on and viewers must suffer through poor dialogue the witty parental remarks are disgusting not funny i remember some awful comment about a garden hoe being compared to well a type of person people call a ho even though the movie is really short it seemed to last forever do not waste your time i know small kids who hated this movie if children cant stand it i do not know how any adults can i would like to fume more about this film but i do not even feel like wasting anymore time writing this review about it i hated it so in summary do not spend  minutes of your life watching this see a good moviebr br  starsthe lowest review i have ever given a movie
