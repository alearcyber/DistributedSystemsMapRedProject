NEG mr and mrs smith is one of the not too well known early american hitchcocks movie but if lifeboat wich unfortunately also belongs to this category is an underrated masterpiece not all the movies signed by the master of suspense in that time the early s are really worth seeing and to tell the truth not discovering this film isnt really a lostbr br mr and mrs smith is an average and conventional screwball comedy where its rather hard to find the hitchcocks touch maybe you can catch a glimpse of his shadow wich isnt much in the cruelty that carole lombard is sometime capable of but its well hidden in an impersonal package in a vertigo scene where two of the characters are trapped on top of a trade fair attraction and maybe in the character of the mother and thats about it  even for the hitchcock fan there is little to connect withbr br and for the screwball comedies amateur there isnt very much more none of the situation are exaggerated enough for being really funny and were far from the masterpieces of hawks for instance and if one or two scene are quite amusing therere not even the funniest in hitchcocks filmography who created comical situations in almost all his movies even psycho could be considered full of very dark humor so there is really little to save in this movie that can without annoying anyone or maybe only both hardcore fans of hitchcock and screwball comedy who are in love with carole lombard stays one of the not too well known early american hitchcocks movie
