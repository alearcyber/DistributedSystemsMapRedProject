NEG the opening scene really got me into watching the movie however not more than  minutes later i was already gouging my eyes out not only could i not understand a word that was said the acting could have been better by a group of mentally handicapped the one highlight of this movie was that there was a punk white midget however i didnt quite get the connection on how a white midget was the child of two african americans but i guess anything is possible also why the hell was robin in the movie im not sure that it added anything artistically overall i would strongly recommend you jump off a cliff before you rent this movie
