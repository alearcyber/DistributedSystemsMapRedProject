NEG this line is a good summary of this movie if you have read it and watched  minutes of the movie you will know exactly how the rest of the movie is going to behave some researcher named surgei pronounced sirgay are searching for hell in the underworld of moscow however he seems to have disappeared and his friend oven follows with a team to search after him could they have find a more boring plot some bad actors looking after an old man in the underground the acting is very bad the romance really feels pointless and untrue often there is no good reason for the way the characters are acting nothing is scary and most of all theres not happening anything interesting in the whole entire movie they just walk asking some gang leaders and other guys about the way walk some more complain some finds the old man and then they run and finally finds the way out of the undergroundbr br the only thing that provides me from giving this movie the lowest of all ratings is the atmosphere if you just want to see a movie for that this may be a good choice its dark and its mystical and murky however the rest of the movie is really dull you just sit there all the time waiting for the movie to begin or something to happening its actually happening some things but they are not very well performed for example i didnt really notice when one of the characters disappeared and i swear i wasnt sleeping or something and i dont understand whats dangerous with these children they just run around in the underground together scratching it walls with sticks i suppose it is meant to be scary in some waybr br just watch this movie if you are in immediate need of some murky atmospheres
