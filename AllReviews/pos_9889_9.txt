POS this movie is hilarious bright and insightful though perhaps the story would work well involving almost any ethnic group the inherent jewishness of the characters gives extra meaning to the bounty of wonderful dialog there were so many social issues covered in the plot that for that reason alone it would have been worth seeing but the real treasure was in the warm laughter that spread throughout the appreciative audience the medley of complex characters with their various strengths and weaknesses play out their roles with all the pathos and humor one would expect from the shakespearean drama their lives seem to parody this is a film about family  about the often fragile sometimes invisible binding together of diverse personalities and lifestyles first among siblings and parents and inevitably among the larger family of friends and even strangers the technical aspects of the film have given the movie a pace and development that keep the viewer intrigued until the final scene peter falk is amazing as always in his role as family patriarch morris applebaum strong performances by a fine cast include a surprise guest dont miss this movie
