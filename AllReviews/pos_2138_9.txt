POS by the time it opened heavens gate had become to its detriment more a cultural phenomenon than a motion picture at a time when concern about excessive budgets and directorial arrogance were growing it was a convenient target as it was a faroverbudget work by the latest auteur to hit hollywood who had not yet established the track record that would have given him the benefit of the doubt among critics and the industry alike as someone pointed out at the time no one was going to jump on warren beattys evenmore costly and dark reds because beatty was one of us while michael cimino had not achieved that statusbr br but heavens gate was also affected by a cultural change taking place at that time the political move rightwards and toward a more unquestioning patriotism and enshrinement of the myth of the west and the western a few years earlier ciminos demythologizing of the frontier might have seemed timely fresh and a necessary corrective but by  in the wake of the reagan revolution it was thought of as nearly unamericanbr br which is a shame because the film seen from the vantage point of several decades away is a fascinating and thoughtprovoking look at that particular time and place as a world where life was in hobbess words nasty brutish and short kristofferson plays james averill an upperclass easterner who in search of adventure becomes a sheriff in wyoming where he finds himself having to lead a resistance by the settlers and squatters against an attack by a mercenary deathsquad hired by wealthy landowners including averills lifelong best friend in a more innocent time averill and his ragtag army of poor farmers would emerge triumphant but this is anything but a traditional western and when the us cavalry joins the fight here it isnt on the side of the good guysbr br much like the deer hunter ciminos previous film heavens gate spends a great deal of time building up the details of the lives of its principals giving the film an attimes leisurely pace that nevertheless leads to a gripping conclusion with excellent acting a fine musical score and the visual texture that makes one believe one is actually seeing the old west through new eyes heavens gate is a film that rewards repeat viewings i only wish that mgm would put out a new dvd with an improved transfer and a commentary by cimino nonetheless the current version is satisfactory enough to let viewers see what critics in  possibly blinded by the films cultural subtexts managed to missthat heavens gate is a great film
