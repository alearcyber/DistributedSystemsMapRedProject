NEG in order for a thriller to elicit fear suspense or any emotion the story must be believable there is nothing believable or realistic about this film the protagonists have several opportunities to escape or turn the tables but manage to screw it up every time the antagonists who supposedly plan this out and customized their shuttle specifically to trap people sure left a lot of improvisational weapons laying around there is actually one scene where the smart girl has a gun to the head of the main bad guy and decides to scold him instead of pull the trigger this was a thoroughly predictably brainless thriller every character was one dimensional the victims were the usual gutless brainless sheep that deserved to be slaughtered is there anyone on this planet capable of writing an intelligent thriller
