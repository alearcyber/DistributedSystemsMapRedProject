POS after watching oldboy i was a little disappointed by the rest of parks work some of it is good but it never approaches the level of humour and originality that oldboy had this one does it is nothing like oldboy in plot or style but the same level of quality is therebr br the acting is good with kangho song okbin kim and hakyun shin delivering excellent performances kim in particular manages to swap from the creepy horror scenes to the surreal comedy without the slightest misstepbr br the plot is strange with lots of twists and turns and takes a big swipe at the vampire clichsbr br the directing is spot on with tons of pace and humour throughout and some of the most memorable scenes i have ever seen it does boast what is probably the weirdest love scene you will ever seebr br this is just a great film
