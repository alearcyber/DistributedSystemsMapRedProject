NEG pretty visuals and a lot of fights make not a good movie and that is precisely what happened herebr br first off let me admit i am yet to play ffvii i intend to order it soon however i did do research to familiarise myself with the characters and the story however not everyone has the luxury of time to research things like this and advent children demands that knowledge of ffvii is requiredbr br in spite of incredible visuals i cant say there is too much thats new weve seen it in final fantasy the spirits within and apart from some better movement i cant say theyve done lots of superdaring stuff with thisbr br the fight scenes  well they are a bit of fun still how could we ever doubt the result of any of them this one was boringly classic  there were three fights with the bad guys following the standard procedure the hero cloud gets smashed then he almost gets there and gets smashed and then finally wins the reason i say it was boringly classic was that it is used a great deal but in this case is poorly executed ill touch on that laterbr br the english dub seemed fine to me though i didnt watch it in japanese so i shant judge the japanese dub but only the english one ill say this  ive heard plenty of better ones even in my limited repertoirebr br and now the plot ummm what plot let me be frank this movie is nought but a fan service a chance to see the ffvii characters on the big screen with lovely eye candy as i said earlier the fights seem to just happen for no reason the opening fight is never explained kadaj seems to have neither ambition to destroy the world himself nor any real motivation to do anything nasty cloud sits around moping for the entire film and pretty much everyone else gets an obligatory cameobr br really ffvii was an ensemble piece advent children is anything but if theyd managed to give everyone some significant story role star trek first contact proved it was possible i might add then this could have been a lot better naturally that would have changed the plot too which lets be honest is almost set to be better than the one we gotbr br characters were also generally either unused or virtually forgotten the members of avalanche thats the group cloud worked with in ffvii for those who dont know get  scenes  in the case of vincent valentine and some get even less hell the bad guys get more lines than these guys and that is pretty badbr br the music well i dont care if nobuo uematsu is god himself he botched this film big time advent one winged angel was the only decent piece otherwise he couldnt decide whether to be epic and orchestral or fun with electric guitar when he switched from one to the other you felt it as though hed taken a sledgehammer to your headbr br and that last point on whether this movie was epic or fun it tried to be both and failed miserably honestly you cant please everyone and do everything the movie also tried to be deep you can go epic and deep or fun and deep but all three is too much but failed here too the last scene which is reminiscent of a baptismal ceremony was thrown in there for what looks like the sake of it you dont need to be a christian to just shake your head and cry there that scene just didnt belong in the film and nor did aeriths frequent appearances  shes dead jimbr br given just how fantastic ive heard final fantasy vii to be this movie is nothing short of a gigantic disappointment because of the beautiful visuals i give it a  out of
