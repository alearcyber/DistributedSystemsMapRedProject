NEG to sum this movie up it is labute carrying his sadism over into the realm of comedic farce the predictable result is that he is constantly stepping on all the jokes by insisting on surrounding them with bloodcurdling violence and extremely hateful characters there is also evidence of his continuing efforts to insult and ridicule everything in sight but then to apologize for it with weak gestures to the pc basically the movie just doesnt work its plot is beyond contrived the characters are onedimensional cliches there is no consistency or development of anything and the comedy where it is not totally out of place is the worst kind of high concept drivelbr br morgan freeman and renee zellweger are completely wasted on characters that seem like parodies of studiodriven audience panderingno matter what make them likeable neutral and neutered and full of moral platitudes crispin glover is in here just long enough to convince you that he doesnt belong in movies anymore chris rock actually has negative chemistry with fellow hitman freemanits as if they are acting in different rooms even when they are two inches away from each other in effect chris rock seems like a digital insert at least he isnt as annoying as jarjarbr br labutes  minutes may well be up by now its already looking like hes overstayed his welcome
