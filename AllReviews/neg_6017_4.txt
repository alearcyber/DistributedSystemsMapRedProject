NEG christopher guest is the master of the mockumentary werner herzog is one of many documentary greats out there zak penn isnt good at either but he could certainly take a lesson from the other two guest often plays around with reality and fiction but the line between the two is always clear in his films sort of an essential with a mockumentary penn could also take a lesson from the the blair witch project even though you knew it was a fake documentary going in you totally bought into the world the filmmakers created it seems to the audience as if the whole thing is real even though you know deep down youre watching fiction in other words it was fiction successfully disguised as truth in fact many early audiences watching it at sundance and other premiere audiences thought it was real penn whose forte by his own admission is screen writing should probably stick to that documentary or mockumentary filmmaking and its hard to tell where one begins and the other ends with this film is obviously not br br penn sets the stage for what he tries to sell as a legit documentary on the filming of a documentary sort of a metadocumentary penn however confuses the audience and loses their trust from the getgo as he enters herzogs house before the filming of herzogs film enigma of loch ness about the myth of the loch ness monster a film which apparently was never finished  probably because of penns interference even though penn is apparently the director of the film were watching he starts it by looking at the cameras and saying what is the film crew doing here and starts shying away from them he does this on a couple other occasions as well he will stop and tell the cameras to stop filming thus forcing the camera guy to hide in the shadows to pick up snippets of dialogue between herzog and penn it seems to be a gimmick but that is never made clear and penn is apparently keeping us in the dark intentionally this leaves the audience scratching its head wondering who is in charge here if penn is working against his own film crew what kind of a world are we a part of this is just one of many examples of how he confuses the line between reality and fiction br br penn seems to only fully enter the fictional world i think when the crew has sightings of what appears to be the loch ness monster but by the time the monster makes its first appearance we have totally exited the fictional world penn has attempted to create so it all just seems silly and pointless br br this is a potentially fascinating movie and a real missed opportunity in that penn has a chance to document a master at work but completely loses focus and it becomes a movie about penn and his antics instead of the filming of a documentary penns presence begins to pervade and overshadow everything else in the movie br br the herzog interviews are convincing and we actually believe he isnt acting we even start to wonder if he and others on his crew are being duped by penn much the way the audience is but youre never sure of even that penn in his interviews to the camera attempts to be quirky and unintentionally funny like the characters interviewed in a guest mockumentary but he only succeeds in being annoying in a guest film this effect is hilarious while here it falls flat because youre never sure what penn is about as a result we the audience start to dislike him as much as the crew apparently does aside from the beautiful scenery and the superfluous appearance out of nowhere of a beautiful model thrown in to give the movie spice there is little to recommend here perhaps its only redeeming quality an unintentional one at that is that its a great example of why the audience is important and by completely ignoring the conventions of storytelling your doing them a disservice for that reason alone i think this would be a good film to show to film students  sort of a what not to do kind of movie i have nothing against a movie told in an unconventional way as long its done skillfully with a thematic base to give it substance this film is completely lacking in thatbr br id like to call it a valiant effort at something but im not sure what it is other than a complete mess and ultimately a waste of time br br as a side note it seems like bad art always calls to mind good this film made me think of the book picture by lillian ross ross followed john huston around during the filming of the red badge of courage and brilliantly documented it for the new yorker it would make a great movie in fact if you want a great example of metaart read it
