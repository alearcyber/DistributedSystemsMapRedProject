POS as i sat in the theater almost crying to myself in dismay over the atrocity ron howard and tom hanks call the da vinci code i could not see the light at the end of the tunnel that is angels and demonsbr br hanks and company are back for the sequelprequel angels and demons and they have learned their lessonbr br acting wise everyone is much better aylet zurer is very good as vittoria vetra and better than the girl who played sophie neveau tom hanks is very good as always he is better in this though because he works harder at giving the movie the feeling that it is a thriller i think ewan mcgregor does the best job of any of the actors he might even deserve a nomination come march but doubtful he had me convinced right until the very end hes dynamic and faithful but rational and realizes that the church needs to put their past behind them the minor actors also do very good jobsbr br technically and visually the movie is much improved the cinematography is muchmuch better and the visual effects are superb the final explosion sequence at the end is excellent howard does a masterful job taking you through a tour of romebr br pacing wise ron howard does an amazing job this time around at keeping the story moving and not boring us with a history lesson deemed at denouncing christianity the movie also makes you feel like more is at stake in our feeble minds discovering whether or not jesus had children is not as high up on the list compared to a cataclysmic explosion killing thousands including the roman catholic church part of the reason i think the story is so fast paced is due to the excellent score i cannot say enough about the score it was epic at times like something from lord of the rings but then sometimes it felt like a bourne movie which is a nice mixbr br my only complaint about this movie is that it is ridiculously far fetched the chances of the carmelengo being someone of ewan mcgregors age are highly improbable and the chances of a cardinal with an adopted son getting elected pope are even more ridiculous not to mention the whole antimatter thing which has yet to be created and dan brown wrote the book in br br overall angels and demons is much tighter knitt faster paced more exciting and more important movie than the da vinci code this is must see thriller for anyone who loves history and mystery combined into one
