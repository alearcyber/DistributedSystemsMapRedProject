POS the big names in film tried to do their part for the war effort and charlie chaplin was no exception this patriotic and propagandist picture is part of his contribution although the war was nearly over by the time of its release the tramp goes to war humorously accomplishes acts of heroism and kicks the kaiser in the bum its a very funny film although i dont think it nearly one of his best its with a dogs life as his better output for first national before he made his early masterpiece the kid they are his first threereelers which contain sustained more elaborate gags than he could usually orchestrate in his tworeel shorts at mutualbr br it can be difficult to balance a prowar message with slapstick antics and scenes of burlesque on the front but one wouldnt think so watching shoulder arms its also preferable in many respects to a more serious dramatic work with a similar message such as griffiths hearts of the world chaplin had become a true virtuoso of screen comedy by this time he makes it look effortless he knew very well by now that a film with fewer gagswith more elaboration refinement and careful timingcould be better than any knockabout keystonetype farce with a dozen pratfalls a minute the sequence where chaplin is disguised as a tree is a pertinent example even with wars raging chaplin can lift the spirits of millions
