NEG im a fan of this generally excellent though sometimes rather dull show but season  has taken some terrible plot directions the episode hero is an example of what i meanbr br the story as it eventually unravels is that the cylons deliberately allow bulldog  a pilot captured several years earlier during a black ops mission  to escape steal a cylon ship and get back to galactica the plan is that when bulldog gets back he will figure out that adama left him to his fate and be so enraged that he will kill adama which he very nearly doesbr br now the problem is this  the cylons set it up so that bulldog thinks he has escaped by himself this means that bulldog gets off the cylon ship with no assistance so he kills a cylon and walks out of his holding cell  that much we see then we must suppose that he walks to the flight hangar manages to get into a cylon fighter ship and learn how to operate it takes off and flies back to galactica just like thatbr br now starbuck managed to get one of them working in season one which was barely believable in itself but she only had to fly it visually out of orbit before making contact with galactica bulldog has to programme his ship so that it makes several jumps through hyperspace and manages to catch up with galactica somewhere thousands of light years away in an unknown direction how does he manage to programme a ship that contains completely alien technology cylons connect to their computers by touch there are no visual consoles or keyboards and having managed that miraculous feat how does he then know where galactica is bearing in mind that galactica took off some  years before and is trying ever since to evade the cylons  it does not leave beacons behind even allowing for the suspension of disbelief that must apply to any scifi show this episode still absolutely no sense whatsoever
