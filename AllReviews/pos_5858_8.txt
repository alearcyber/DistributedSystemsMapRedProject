POS murder by numbers is a pretty good movie even though the plot rolls along at a snails pace what with sandra bullocks character getting all mixed up with her partner and the movie flashing back to a previous trauma situation she had been in it does succeed in keeping the viewer involved in the filmbr br having said that i do think that it does a good job in setting that eerie sort of who done it type atmosphere it keeps you guessing at which one of the boys really was behind the murder if not both of them i think ryan gosling and that other kid lol do a good job of selling that bully versus dork relationship not sure about gosling playing a badass but for a guy who would later star in a movie like the notebook he did a pretty good job once the movie gets rolling though i really found myself involved in the story sort of asking myself oh my god what would i do if i were in that situation like i said a good csi type movie maybe not for the extreme crime drama movie junkie but a good all around flickbr br  outta
