NEG my website theflickguyorg lists michael as one of the worst films of the modern era the following is an excerpt br br everyone slums some time in their lives this was travoltas turn i still dont know what the point of this terrible film was nora efron has proved to be a competent writer and director so what the hell happened here the archangel michael takes a new spin here and is portrayed as a hamfisted chainsmoking sugar addicted fornicating slob whose biggest contribution to humanity after sending lucifer to hell was that he invented standing in line yes how funny and charming i dont find this offensive i find it stupid in its defense i can say that the ending was ever bit unsatisfying as the rest of this painful attempt at story telling
