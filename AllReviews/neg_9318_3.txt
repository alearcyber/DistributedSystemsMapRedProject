NEG ok last night i saw the world premiere of paul schraders the exorcist the beginning at the brussels international festival of fantasy films with all the commotion around the film it was highly anticipatedbr br the director was there and so were most of the stars except skarsgardbr br unfortunately the movie sucked big time it was a real disappointment for me because im a huge fan of both shrader and friedkins rip original  filmbr br what was wrong with it most of it actually the fx you would think that the matrix and lotr digital revolution never happened it was so badly rendered the editing no real pace or rhythm the acting only skarsgard at times could convince the script was a imo set up to explain the african scenes in the original film so the movie had the feel of a set up scene only it contributed nothingbr br the only thing that i did like was vittorio storaros cinematography although ive seen better from him apocalyps nowbr br all of the time i was thinking this was just a rough cut a work in progress and that given the well known circumstances is probably what it is but that doesnt change the obvious problems with the scriptbr br i had the chance to meet schrader very briefly but i didnt have the guts to tell him what i thought of the film and i was so nervous this is the guy who wrote taxi driver for christ sake that i forgot to ask him to sign my copy of his taxi driver script
