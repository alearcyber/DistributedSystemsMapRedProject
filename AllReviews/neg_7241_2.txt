NEG if i was still  i might find it scary it is i guess a low budget film the acting is not good but could be worse  the filming and special effect is awful the story line is thin and not worth to dwell on too much time is used on boring shouting scenes the chases or fight with aliens remind me of kids fighting with scary masks on some gore with blood and body parts  would scare a  year old kid i guess apparently scare the crap out of some of the persons in the filmbr br it is far from reaching anything like the film tremorsbr br this turns out to be an incident and we see alien ships nearby earth it make you wonder if any will make a sequel
