POS i must say one big reason why i thought the aristocats was so great is because i love catsi love catswhich probably gave this film a big score from mebut not only thatit was definitely a good movie as welland i love where they make the setting of the film take placethis is one of my favorite animal filmsalthough its animatedand i really love how the actorsactresses didnt sound so unprofessional behind the animals voicesto me this film seems like a classicbut i guess to imdb its notbecause it hasyes i think too low of a ratingyou take a peek at all the other original disney films and they have a much higher rating than thisbut nonetheless aristocats is one of the best animation movies there is and i could enjoy it over and over again
