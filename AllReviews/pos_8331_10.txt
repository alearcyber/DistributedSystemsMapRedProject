POS great documentary of how scientists believed dinosaurs behaved captured with some of the most spectacular cgi since jurassic park done completely seriously like a prehistoric episode of nation geographic grabs your attention from the first frame and never lets go my favorite part was when the diplodocus fights off the allosaurosbr br  stars this is what science is all about
