NEG first of all just let me say this ghost storyhellobr br if any of the other people who trashed this movie from beginning to end realized this fact their reviews would have been very different the fact that characters kept disappearing whenever the protagonist turned back to look should have been a dead giveaway this movie was not billed as a ghost story when you went to rent it in the video store not even a hint and that is the biggest mistake that was made by the studio who marketed it it was deliberate on their part not to market it as a ghost story in order to confuse you like the main character is confused as you try to make sense of it the problem in this is that they lost too many viewers the ghosts appeared too human and real without any of the usual telltale signs imagery or special effects that hollywood usually uses to let you know you are now seeing a ghostand that is what they were trying to do the main character does not know she is seeing ghosts and neither does the viewer now do you get it as long as you understand that the main character is seeing ghosts then youll understand the movie and not be so irritated by what is perceived as major oversights in continuity or plot flawsbr br i admit this being said it still was not a good movie just not as bad a just about everyone else made it out to be just understand if you plan on watching this movie everything you see aint always what what you think it is  out of  for acting  for originality  for plot and  for scare factor though there was some gore and spooky moments still not a good movie just way misunderstood
