POS i saw this film a week ago and i had to persuade my friend to come with me because this film seems to be getting such bad reviews sure it is no human traffic or lock stock but is by no means a flop i think the fact that there are so many big budget films out at the moment means it has been ignored but it shouldnt be i reckon it sets out to do what it wants to do entertain us for an hour and a half and leave us feeling happy and contented i would much rather go and see it that the mummy which looks boring and no im not a teenager dont listen to the critics star wars fans didnt this film is well worth seeing if just to see the gorgeous luke de lacey and rupert penryjones go see it
