POS this is a classic movie that dramatizes the plight of a man who cannot adjust to changes taking place in society and feels more and more alienated which leads to violence joe is a worker and he is dissatisfied and angry and all he is needs is a pretext to lash out which is what the story is about alone joe is quiet together with someone else he becomes lethal and what makes the character of joe even more chilling is that he fully rationalizes his violence so that to him its not only not bad its necessary for joe projects his own violent tendencies onto those who he considers the enemy and therefore considers himself to be in a war and in this movie the generation gap is portrayed as a war but it is a war in joes mind only because the enemy in this case is in his imagination nobody wants to fight joe but joe feels he must defend himself although this movie was released in  its message is as relevant now as it was then as society continues to undergo major changes which lead to the kind of intense alienation that the movie effectively dramatizes
