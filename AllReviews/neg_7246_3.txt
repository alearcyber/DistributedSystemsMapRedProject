NEG i happened to have seen this movie this morning on tcm very bad acting low budget and poor plot are the impressions i felt while watching the movie the only highlight of the movie was watching tender young rita moreno  years old playing a teenage indian squaw in love with an older man in his s she reminded me of a earlier version of sue lyon as lolita  only a more innocent lolita she bounces up and down like a s teeny bopper almost as if you would expect her to be chewing gum falling all over this old man willing to give him anything as he plays it off like shes a hindrance to him any man in his s that had a beautiful virgin teenage girl willing to do anything for him and be his bride would be insane not to take advantage of her its too bad that the censorship board back when this movie was released didnt permit more of an expansion of a character such as rita morenos the only reason why i gave this movie a  instead of a  is rita morenos appearance in the movie
