POS i didnt have very high expectations about just before dawn i dont know why i keep buying these slasher movies when i know its all the same every time maybe im a bit masochistic anyway im glad i bought this one yes its all the same no it has nothing original yes its about a little group of teenagers going in the woods to camp drink and have sex yes they get killed one by one by a maniac and you know what its just magic its one of the best experiences i had watching a slasher movie the places where its shot are so wonderful you see mountains waterfalls rockies its just amazing it takes a very long time except for the opening scene before the killer starts killing but i didnt care it was enjoyable to watch enough not to care what i mean is you wont be sitting there waiting for the murders to start because every thing that happens is enjoyable because of the beauty of the film itself the ending is a bit weird but i wont tell you anything more about it youll know what i mean another thing i enjoyed you care about the characters theyre not just a bunch of jerks who spend their time bitching each other sure they are pure stereotypes of usual slasher characters but theres something special about them anyway its a great horror movie and i hope you have a pretty good time watching it because i really did
