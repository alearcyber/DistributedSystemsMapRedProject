NEG this movie is something horrible i was laughing all the time i was forced to stop in some scenes because my mom thought its not polite to laugh when people are dying but in this movie even death looks ridiculous especially when tornado tommy is sucked into one tornadobr br explosions of cars thrown onto buildings by the forces of wind look like ones from the old school side scroller game called rtype dialogues are very bad and i am interested how they managed to persuade some of the actors to play in this movie it is simply amazing how such bad movie can make it into the tvbr br only real reason to watch this movie is to have some fun of nonsense and absurdity
