POS its a good watch if u have time  deals with three friends who get into a needless bar fight and get into serious trouble they find themselves fighting some shadowy people and cant deal with very very disturbing portrayal of japan the arbitrariness of modern life some intense scenes but a bit of a potboilerbr br the spoiler was that the plot is not too clear based on english sub titles obviously i dont know japanesebr br the only other japanese movies ive seen were kurosawa who is a different and far loftier than this modern genre so cant really compare otherwise it compares better with most hollywood blockbusters for story plot and buildupbr br taptieg
