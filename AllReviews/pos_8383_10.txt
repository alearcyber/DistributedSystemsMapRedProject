POS i must admit when i saw the preview for inglorious basterds i gave myself big expectations this film did not disappointbr br rarely when i watch a movie with such highexpectations do i have those expectations met or exceeded this film did that and more even more rarely do i clap at the end of a movie this i and everyone else in the theater didbr br i have to say i am a little biased towards quentin i grew up with pulp fiction i watched it when i was  and it is still my favorite and most influential filmbr br however since then quentin has not really lived up to his billing his style was getting a little predictable instead of familiar the quality honestly wasnt there i never watched jackie brown and then theres grindhouse that is until inglorious basterds what quentin did was exactly what was needed for the war genre a spaghetti western feel that could only be done by tarantino or sergio leone but seeing how leone is dead tarantinos the self appointed guy on this masterpiecebr br so lets look at the movie which i wont give away the writing was spot on a beautiful transition between using not one but four different languages in this movie not to mention this movie was set up in the classic tarantino mold great scenes of rich meaningful dialog and sudden shocking actionbr br the acting was superb christopher waltz deserves an oscar seriously i dont say that often but honestly the man should get one for this movie he spoke every language in this movie and delivered with such amazing touch and poise he stole the show in a movie that everybody was amazingly impressivebr br i have no problem building this movie up because this movie is the best film ive seen all year and probably all of next year quite frankly the more i think about it this movie may crack my top films of all time and is quentins best movie since pulp fiction take it from me watch this film i loved it doesnt do this movie enough justicebr br i watched it yesterday and im still blown away thank you quentin from the bottom of my heart for you making this movie youre back on top again buddy i cant say enough for inglorious basterds
