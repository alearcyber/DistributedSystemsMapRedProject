NEG words cannot describe how asinine juvenileand repetitive this steaming pile of a series is it relies on  things  constant s pop culture references  the tired stretch out a joke to the point of awkwardness bit and  at least  or  pointless flashbacks per episode the only reason i can see for this crap fest being as popular as it is for the constant pop culture references which i suppose elicit an omg lol thats from superfriends that is so totally ironic and i am so edgy and smart for getting it response from the viewer the writing is beyond lazy and panders to its viewers mostly in their s and s plus theres the character design which seems to consist of the same three characters with the same bored expressions drawn over and over again but with different skin colors and maybe a different hairline occasionally insulting crap
