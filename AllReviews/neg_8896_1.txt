NEG hey i know angel isnt the kind of show that gives people a happy ending and i know they couldnt just make everything perfect but i couldnt believe the ending to angel i absolutely love the show its possibly the best show ever however i really hated this ending as well as the whole way the nd half of angel season  went similar to buffy season  my favorite characters deaths were pretty much pointless and did nothing for the plot cordelia was one of the best characters on the show and once she and angel were finally going to get together she turned all evil and into a demon i wanted so badly to have her back dont get me wrong the episode where cordelia comes back is fantastic but i was still really mad she was gone then on earth was up with fred dying right after she finally got with wesley there was no sacrifice it was pointless it did nothing whatsoever for the plot and blue haired demon girl is an awful useless character they spent way too much of the end centered around her another big problem is they didnt connect the elements well enough i know those dudes in that black thorn wanted to bring about the apocalypse but there wasnt even a date set for when it was supposed to happen the apocalypse should have been carried out and discovered throughout the entire season rather than just mentioning there are some evil dudes an hour before the season ends one of the biggest problems is every character who the audience cares about is either dead or has nothing to live for my three favorite characters died and angel spike and gunn who im not sure even survives have no office arent even back to their helping the helpless are in the middle of a huge battle and have lost everyone they care about angel and spike are never redeemed they lose the girl they care about and just about everyones dead and they still have to fight this weird evil army i get the whole you never stop fighting but it was stupid to end it right in the middle couldnt there have been some redemption with knowledge that there would always be many more battles to come i dont get why this episode is so highly rated because i think the buffy ending was  times better and i wasnt even a giant fan of that one why did they have to slip at the end season  and  and st half of five were so amazing then they went and messed up the show
