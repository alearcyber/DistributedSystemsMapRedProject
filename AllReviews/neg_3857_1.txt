NEG i cant believe that there are people out there who voted  for this garbage have any of you gained access to a computer in the madhouse where you are undoubtably kept or is there a special colony where especially crass people are secretly imprisoned that i dont know aboutbr br if i was to say what i really thought of this film none of it would get publishedbr br to begin with its star is a no talent idiot who acts like a bad impersonator of jim carrey who has hoovered enough angel dust up his nose to resurface the sahara desert his name will be a total guarantee that i will not watch a future film with him in it  even if he plays a rock hidden by a crowdbr br as for the plot one more crime that we can chalk up to the nazis is that they were so awful that they can be considered fair game as baddies in tripe like this mere criminals and murderers would have the audience on their side in a tricebr br to the people who made this movie  give up making films and if not then confine yourself to making advertisements where your efforts will at least have the virtue of being fleeting in durationbr br finally a criticism of imdb  why dont you have the facility to vote zero for a film or perhaps not to express my contempt for this tripe i would then have to vote double zero or something
