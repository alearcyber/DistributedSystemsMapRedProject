POS the animation is still the slightly rougher style of the first episode simpsons roasting on an open fire but already with this first regular episode bart the genius the humor is beginning to be more layered quicker and greater depth of characterization is already appearingbr br this episode firmly establishes barts slacker personality and more subtly lisas intellectual superiority to the whole family although thats the main theme of the whole episode theres also a nice secondary theme of bart and homers fatherson relationship its given to us first in a nutshell as the episode opens with the simpsons playing scrabble lisa comes up with id for her wordshort but something you have to be well educated to know she has to read the definition to the rest of the family from the dictionary which has been serving as a way to prop up the couch marge can only come up with he homer has oxidize already sitting on his tray in order but doesnt recognize that its a word so he presents do instead bart comes up with kwyjibo which he insists is a word similarly in the main plot line of the episode bart cheats on his iq test which leads to his being put into a special school full of gifted kids we know thats not likely to last longbr br the simpsons has always had a lot of fun playing with varying degrees of intellectual abilities among people through its characters and more importantly they way that people with vary degrees of intellectual abilities fit into or not are accepted or not and are perceived in society aside from beginning to present bart lisa homer and marges place in this context this episode already starts respectfully poking fun at nerds and geeks outside of the simpsons family via some of the dialogue from the students at the special school as well as some of the other references including purely visual ones this episode also shows that the simpsons isnt going to pull any punches by means of writing or talking down to its audience it may be just a cartoon but its a cartoon that intellectuals geeks and nerds are going to understand more than anyone else and that fact aside from it just being a very funny show is the key to the shows longevity
