NEG terrible absolutely terrible long confusing and unrewarding after about three hours of this painful mess the ending truly is the final nail in the coffin not even the magnificent sexy beautiful goddess francesca annis can save this poor adaptation of agatha christies work the plot drags and drags and time goes by slowly and suddenly you realize that you dont even have any idea of whats going on anymore by the end even with the usual explanation by the villain theres still a lot thats left unexplained and then its over a complete waste of time and without a doubt one of the worst adaptations to bear the name of agatha christie
