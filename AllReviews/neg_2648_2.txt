NEG i went to see random hearts with  friends and at first i thought maybe it was just me who wasnt enjoying the movie after all i didnt like as good as it gets and that movie won all sorts of awards well it wasnt just menone of my friends liked it either it was unbelievable slow much like getting teeth pulled the only action that is in the movie is what is in previews we didnt walk out of the theatre because we all assumed something more would happen we werent as smart as the  or  people who did walk out i have never walked out on a movie in my life but i definitely should have this is all tough for me to write considering i am relatively easy to please when it comes to movies it takes a lot for me to think a movie is awesome but not much for me to just like it this movie didnt even come close in the like category not only was the movie about  hours too long but it was like two separate trite stories in one but they werent smoothly sewn together plus the soundtrack if you could even call it that was so annoying like seinfeld has the same riff that is played over and over again difference being that i like seinfeldthis movie had this jazz riff that it kept playing which sounded highly inappropriate at times especially when people were dealing with the deaths of the plane crash hard to explain what i mean but trust me it was awful i cannot say enough to make people not waste their money after i left the theatre i honestly wanted to write to the movie company and demand my  backsheeesh i could have gone bowling or something for that money
