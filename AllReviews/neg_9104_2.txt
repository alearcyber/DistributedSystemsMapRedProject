NEG this movie was bad on so many levels the writing was horrible so even the best actors could not have made this movie watchable its a shame because they did have some good actors in this movie i mean if anyone has seen any of the police academy movies you would know that steve guttenberg was good his character in this movie was very serious which was a big difference from characters i have seen him play before so that was a plus and i did think that steve guttenberg was extremely hot in this movie with or without the shirt you can not deny that he has a great body sexy face too loved the  oclock shadow look it made him look dangerous at one part in the movie he is lying in bed without his shirt and i have to say i would have gladly jumped in there and tried to take his mind off of his problems so honestly i would watch this movie again just to fantasize
