POS i saw this at a test screening in chatsworth a week or so ago and went with a bunch of my girlfriends we all really loved it a lot james franco is amazing and so hot i would see it just for him but sienna miller is also really good and plays a southern girl who is in love with him so much that she cant let go david caradine who was in kill bill plays a cowboy and he is perfect for that the story is kind of strange but if you believe in the power of love and magical things you will love it it is really original and it is also very funny and everyone laughed a lot but by the end it gets more serious and we all ended up crying i am going to see it again with my friends as soon as it comes out it is really good
