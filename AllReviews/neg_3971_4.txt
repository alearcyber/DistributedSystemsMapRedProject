NEG the only reason im even giving this movie a  is because it was made in to an episode of mystery science theater  the horrible direction is only slightly overshadowed by the characters complete inability to act the lead is an actor i have never seen in anything else and it shows no chemistry with the love interest and so bland you almost dont care what happens to him dick sargent was not convincing as a villain least of all this guy was suppose to be super evilhe was more annoying then anything peter graves was the only person the movie that wasnt awful his part was small and even he couldnt compensate for his costars lack of talent in  someone tried to make this mess all over again it was called the islandi personally didnt see that movie but from what i understand its the same movie if you want to laugh at this movie get the mstk episode its really funnyfull of bewitched and biography references it makes this movie finally watchable
