POS so what is batman returns anywaybr br it was marketed as an action film and many people whove seen it seem to think that theyve watched an action film  but really there isnt that much action and tim burton barely seems interested in itbr br people often align it with the grittier superhero comics of the late eighties but honestly if youve read the dark knight returns that seems just a little absurd burtons excessive imaginings have more in common with the dayglo sixties tv series the penguin drives around in a giant plastic duck for goodness sakebr br burtons style is often described as gothic and thats a little closer to what we see on screen the penguin  deformed malign with a tangled history and a subterranean lair  is a gothic menace dressed up in more respectable dickensian clothes  udolfo masquerading as uriah heep br br but what of catwoman she may be raised from the dead but that pvc catsuit is decidedly twentieth century and her alter ego selina kyles world is all boardrooms and apartments  reminiscent of a s romantic comedybr br and then it clicks the smart but downtrodden secretary romanced by a lonely millionaire the ensuing complications caused by deception and disguise batman returns is quite clearly a romantic comedy in the old hollywood style filtered through burtons sm dungeon sensibilities it has more in common with the hudsucker proxy including expressionist sets than it does with other superhero films br br like many a romantic comedy it centres around the makeover of the heroine not from ugly duckling to swan but from doormat to dominatrix michelle pfeiffer gives one of the performances of her often remarkable career shes iconically sexy as catwoman poor halle berry never had a prayer playful and vindictive memorable because she knows how to act with her whole body in retrospect though its her scenes as selina that impress almost every one of them is a little comic gem particularly the glimpse we get of her lonely home life its a delicately balanced tragicomic performance and its in these scenes that the film really sparks to life nothing moves me quite like selina and bruce wayne dancing under the mistletoe to siouxsie and the banshees a gun held between them simultaneously empowered and trapped by their alter egos doomed to conflict forget the easy sentimentality of big fish or the gossamer emotions of edward scissorhands  this is the most heartfelt scene in all of burtons films love revenge fatalism fetishism insanity selfloathing and not a little wit all in a few short lines and absolutely nailed by the actors  particularly pfeiffer br br elsewhere danny de vito almost matches her finding the wounded dignity buried beneath those truly repellent longjohns the uppercrust villain of the comics is revealed to be nothing more than a sham burtons penguin is a feral creature subjected to his own eliza doolittlestyle makeover almost literally an ugly duckling its burtons most radical  and funniest  reinvention christopher walkens max schreck completes a perfect triptych of villains sliding between casual charm and blankeyed psychosis with unnerving ease and is it just me or does his companys logo bring to mind mickey mouse perhaps we should ask former disney animator burtonbr br christopher nolans batman begins  a real action film  has been much praised as the first film to do justice to batman i admire nolans film but it would be a pity if it were allowed to overshadow this idiosyncratic gem
