NEG to be fair i couldnt bear to watch this movie all the way thru so i have no idea if it suddenly gets better half way thru the film but the first  minutes or so are amongst the worst i have seen in a while children under twelve might get a kick out of the poorly written acted and directed slapstick humor but adults in full control of all their faculties should steer clear of this stinker
