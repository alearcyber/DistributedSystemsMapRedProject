NEG if youre a fan of the original series do not see this moviebr br i should have been skeptical from the previews when aeon expresses her motives for murder in the series aeon had no family and no motive for her adventures save selfish interests obviously the chimpwriter in charge felt the movie needed to cater to the bad grrl demographic by making the character deadly but have a good reason to kill peoplebr br you wouldnt have thought it possible but the movie is more two dimensional than the cartoon the characters are all portrayed as inherently good with some conflict of interest that eventually gets resolved all dogs go to heaven and same for every character that dies in this moviebr br the selfishtwistedperverted dominating personas of aeon and trevor are nowhere to be seen in the end they literally develop into a cutesy couple ala annie hall the only character who remained true to the show was the relicle the floating machine in the sky i suppose if you ever thought gee i like aeon flux but i wish it were more like every other faceless goodvevil scifi hollywood slop out there then you are in for a treatbr br they didnt even get the look right i suppose a black metal bikini was too much to ask for but the whole setting is wrong  years into the future sure looks like  years into the past instead of a distinctly urban postapocalyptic world the viewers eyes are offended with a s modsquad frutopia of eggshaped furniture wood paneled walls earth tones and lots of plants bregna was a dystopia not a utopiabr br speaking of bregna thats the only city on earth according to the movie the show is clear that there are two cities bregna and monica which used to be one in the movie the monicans are just hollywood storybook freedomfighters they also have as much technology as the bregnans which is not the case from the showbr br the only possible conclusion is that the real writer for this movie was a high school kid and that he wrote it the day before it was due to the studio execs and hes never seen an entire aeon flux all the way through the overwhelming amount of inconsistency with the cartoon is baffling beyond using certain names like aeon flux trevor goodchild and bregna the movie is nothing like the showbr br the actual bulk of the movie seems to try to blend the colorful plots of soylent green blade runner logans run and tomb raider which came out a dull brown mess
