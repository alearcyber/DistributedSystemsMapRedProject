NEG this really is the worst movie i have ever seen for a while i made a habit of watching lousy movies including battlefield earth delta force commando and starship all of these movies are cinematic gems compared to ironheartbr br there isnt much point in summarizing this piece of junk i think its more beneficial to summarize my reaction to the movie which is as follows i become furiously angry and i want to rip the tape out of the vcr and burn it after roughly  minutes of playbr br i rate this movie a  but imdb does not let one rate a movie less than  i give it a  knowing full well that i am saying any movie that has any score above  is infinitely undefinably many times better than this one  thats really how bad it is
