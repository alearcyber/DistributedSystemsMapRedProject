POS a talented high school graduating senior with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state allstar high school football game when he meets and falls for an attractive local girl she helps him realize he has a shot at a full ride scholarship if he plays wellbr br all too often these dramas fall into formulaic traps and tell the same old story of a troubled and confused teen full rides matt sabo certainly fits this profile but below the surface is a much more unique individual than we usually see in this genre matt is the center of the action and he is a realistic teenager both overconfident and vulnerable optimistic and cynical by turns influenced by amy matt grows into a man of character and heart he in turn forms friendships with his teammates which influences his growth as an athlete and as a team playerbr br full ride has all the elements we love to see in a moviegreat acting admirable characters exciting sports scenes poignant drama and a love story still while one may have seen these elements in other films full ride is assisted by performances that are sincere and occasionally even moving perhaps whats most impressive about full ride is its sense of reality although the author of the previous comment would seem to disagree clearly a disgruntled student who for quite obvious reasons received a poor grade in his film class director mark hoeger grounds the film in a believable situation and location and does a great job of getting down to the grit of what life is like in a small town these characters are real people rooted in realistic situations which often create the most compelling entertainment on one level it is a love story on another it is a character study and yet another it is a simple football film all of these ideas come together to form a cohesive vehicle
