NEG my wife received tickets for our family to attend the premier of this movie from her employer for free i only regret the price of the popcorn and the two hours of my life wasted on this garbage filmbr br i own the dvd of the original mask and quite enjoyed it i expected a remake nowhere near the original in production values or writing but wasnt prepared for this vulgar pile of trash weak acting poor plot a bad cgi baby passing gas and urinating in hyper mask mode a woman turned into a giant nose spewing mucous fun huh my eight year old son loves movies like lord of the rings harry potter and star wars after this was over i asked him what he thought his exact words i hated it its like the scooby doo movie they take something good and have to put all that gross stuff in my twelve year old daughter and wife hated it as well my wife later told me that my son asker her twice during it if we could leave hes never done that before im proud of him lest you think im some kind of puritan from the groans and lack of laughter i heard in the theater i think most of the patrons agreed with mebr br this film represents everything bad about childrens entertainment today and any positive reviews must be from people financially connected with the film
