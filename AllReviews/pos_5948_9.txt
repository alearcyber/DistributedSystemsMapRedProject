POS the two new oss  movies has a kind of humor which is both intelligent and dumbeddown at the same time which i find extremely amusing it really reminds me of the classic pink panther movies with an almost as good leading man as peter sellers in jean dujardin and unlike steve martin completely ruining clouseau dujardin is quite brilliantbr br the comments regarding the movies being antisemitic are obviously a case of a complete lack of humor and therefor understandingbr br whether you will enjoy or hate this movie really comes down to what kind of humor you have i cant wait for the sequel
