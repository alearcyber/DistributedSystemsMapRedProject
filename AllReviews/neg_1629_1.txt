NEG even mstk couldnt make this painful long and ultimately mindbending drek funny or entertaining while most bad movies in and of themselves are hilariously bad this one is one of those few videos that uses the word bad in its literal sensebr br the element that makes this so painful to watch is not the lack of story but the fact that soooo much background is crammed into the first halfhour that it is utterly ridiculous and harder to follow than a highway while driving with no headlightsbr br the hero of the film ator is no more than eyecandy for this literal energysucker of a film dressed in a loincloth and sporting pecs like melons as joel put it he belongs more in a fitness magazine than herebr br i would recommend this only to diehard and i mean diehard followers of cheese if you have an enemy recommend them this film if you make it through this i commend you you should be able to make it through anything
