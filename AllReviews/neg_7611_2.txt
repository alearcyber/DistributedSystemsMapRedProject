NEG i havent reviewed on imdb before but this documentary is so overrated that i felt compelled to vent i wouldnt have even finished watching if i hadnt been a guest at someones house the film was poor on many levels first  treadwells video footage was contrived the more i watched the more he seemed to be acting as a person desperate to be famous instead of one acting out of convictionbr br second  the others in the film with the exception of treadwells parents and the airline pilot were just as contrived and corny as he was god they seemed artificialbr br third  treadwells mission to protect the bears doesnt even make sense as he did more harm than good by making the bears grow accustomed to human presence i believe that treadwell really did love the bears but there is much research which indicates his efforts were misguided sometimes we have to sacrifice our enjoyment of wildlife to really helpbr br fourth  the films entertainment value wasnt half that of other wildlife films such as march of the penguins and winged migration the filmmakers in my opinion did a poor job of sequencing scenes and gave little incentive to keep watchingbr br as a person who loves alaska bears and other wildlife i would love to see more people dedicated to the preservation of our wildlands hopefully their efforts will be less peoplecentered
