NEG i did a review for this directors fictional recreation about btk i had also seen this movie and it was terrible please save your money and time this movie was terrible and this director is untalented i do not understand how he is funding these movies they are horrible i have decided to make sure that i check who the writer director and producer are and if this directors name pops up i will not waste my money there is nothing worse than renting a movie on a friday night making the popcorn and then realizing you have been duped by creative art on the front of the movie box stay away so i guess i should make up some stuff to fill in the lines i have always checked imdb for reviews before but i think i will not anymore this is ridiculous i have been corrected in my reviews far too many times not enough lines you may cancel my account your site is a pain
