NEG this movie has some good performances as others have pointed out but suffers as others have pointed out except for the people who apparently are either friends of the filmmaker or the cast to otherwise explain why they would deem this a  from some selfconscious and selfabsorbed film school padding and excess plots this is the type of plot that sex in the city could handle in a half hour episode so there was no reason for it to be even an  minute movie a perfect example of wasted footage is the fast forwarding montage in the first third of the movie some of the back story is merited but too much time for example was spent on daria character with the anal sex boyfriend and on the back story for paulie who was not a realistic character although the actor did a decent job with the lines he was given br br the worst aspect of the movie was the level of amateurish parts from typos in the typed material to bad jumps and edits poor camera positions angles lighting problems throughout and most glaringly a poorly written script with a badly developed concept if the writer also the director and lead had collaborated with someone he might not have ended up with a  rotten score on rotten tomatoes which further belays the ability of anyone to truly believe the people who gave it a  on the rating system here
