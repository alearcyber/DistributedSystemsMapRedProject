POS never mind if national velvet  is a bit hackneyed and occasionally unconvincing clarence browns equestrian fable is an endearing and very likable story with a good moral after achieving modest success through her appearance in lassie come home  young elizabeth taylor age  landed her first leading role as velvet brown a passionate schoolgirl with an obsession for horses though filmed in california the story  adapted from a novel by enid bagnold  is set in a small township on the english countryside and full advantage is taken of the technicolor photography to present the vibrant and handsome landscapes of blue skies and green shrubs mickey rooney takes top billing as mi taylor a misguided exjockey with devious intentions whose relationship with young velvet reawakens his sense of dignity and opens a new optimistic chapter in his life though he noticeably struggles in one sequence when he must confess the traumatic experience that led to his fear of horses rooney is enjoyable as the surly but passionate young man who must prove his worthbr br it is perhaps a good thing that elizabeth taylor had those entrancing violet eyes because her acting abilities at this young age were rather limited her more emotional sequences in which she displays courage and integrity in the face of adversity strike one as being rather hollow and the touchinglynaive notion that simply believing will accomplish everything is one that has since been repeated ad nauseam by practically every unmemorable inspirational sporting film ever made nevertheless taylor is brighteyed and enthusiastic and she works well with mickey rooney who was no stranger to being a childstar anne revere plays a very important role as velvets mother once a famous athlete who not only swam the english channel but was lovinglytrained by none other than mi taylors own father i liked that mi was not told about this until the films final seconds with mrs brown correctly deciding that the young man would first need to develop his own sense of decency rather than exploiting the memory of his late father for financial gain as he would undoubtedly have done at the films beginningbr br the film reaches its climax at the grand national sweepstakes where velvet has at the last moment decided to ride her own horse the pi in the worldfamous competition under the guise of a latvian male she goes on as expected to win the race but is later disqualified  either because shes a girl or because she tumbled from the horse before she was allowed to dismount what a stupid rule this extended race sequence is exceedingly welldone effectively capturing the nervous tension of those nerveracking prerace seconds and the confusion of the event that places us in the same position as rooneys character stranded behind tall spectators and waiting anxiously for somebody to provide an accurate update it doesnt really matter that we know its a stunt double doing most of the difficult riding  in several scenes we can clearly see a creepylooking man in a wig  but the positive message remains the same ill wager that national velvet has nurtured the imaginations of millions of young girls over the last sixty years and its power to inspire has decreased little with time
