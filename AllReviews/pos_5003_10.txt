POS this is a great show with total freshness and innovation that usual chair couch for a woman host that mandatory band playing monotonous tunes the same old jokes the same pattern copied from the days of nebuchadnezzer probably the pattern of johnny carson copied by one and all latterman leno conan daly this show does not seem to have any of thesebr br i fell in love with this show within the first  minutes and i am going to stick to it though its too early to say that this show seems to be devoid of any intellectual pretension most talk shows try so hard to project and i hope that that is what would make this show different from all the rest i hope that this show will last longbr br returning back after months i still love this show and i love his selfdeprecating humor for example his affirmation that only pothead loners would be home to watch his show at saturday midnight and thus the jokes are funny only to the stoned guys which however does not involve the usual monkeying of conan obrien for example i know its a cardinal sin to be repelled by obriens antics but i do really dislike his style and repetitiveness br br i again watched it the other night with tom arnold in it ferensens spoof of trading spouses and nanny  in an earlier episode are hilarious idiot paparazzi are fun especially when a security guard cautions them against taking peoples pictures and if i am not mistaken they start taking his pictures shouting gary colemanbr br added on th april  coming back once again i am left confused by the neighbor and her dog i cannot decide if it is a joke or a real thing either way it was funny as hellbr br i do not expect spike feresten to read these pages but maybe he does he is crazier than a bunch of monkeys and so i would better write down my suggestion here for him i would like him to do a full  minute show with crazy gideon the star of late night tv commercial i would like crazy gideon to have an interview in spikes talk show sing a song and play guitar do a skit in the line of snl and also to answer questions from the audience regarding his potential mayorship of los angeles i know crazy gideon may not be aware of this but there are websites detailing why he would be the perfect candidate for the post of the mayor of labr br god willingbr br returning back on th july  someone wrote here that the people who praised spikes talkshow must be bribed by spike i confess that spike really bribed me but i must also confess that rockefeller named me in his will and last night i had sex with cindy crowford
