POS the primary plus for this movie is the combination of chris farley and david spade this was the first film in which this comedy duo displayed their laurelandhardyesque brand of humor farleys obvious physical comedy skill is perfectly augmented by spades sarcastic take on every situation they find themselves inbr br this movie stands apart from other comedy movies tommy boy ranks in with blues brothers as a comedic work whose individual scenes and bits stem from the plot rather than serve to break up the storyline and give the film a disjointed feel as so many other comedic films do thanks to excellent direction by sagal every scene is tight and immediately foreshadows or acts out the story being told he is as much to credit for the films hilariousness as farley and spade are the acting of dennehy lowe ackroyd and many others see the gas station attendant  miles from davenport strengthen the filmbr br the film warrants multiple viewings because there are many fine nuaces to the film that may be overshadowed by farleyspadebr br i believe this film is very wellmade and is the funniest movie i have ever seen
