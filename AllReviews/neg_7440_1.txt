NEG its a shame that they didnt trust the original enough to build on it br br but robocop  takes the great ideas imagination and characters of the original and replaces them with all the stereotypes that sequels have to offerbr br the beginning commercial was cute and so was the scene that follows reminiscent of the beginning in guys and dolls but aside from a flash of thought here and there this is one film that is a slow dirty slog down into the middle of nowherebr br ideas are introduced then dropped interesting characters from the original hardly get any screen time here most of the new characters cain juliette faxx are so boring that they wouldnt hold up no matter what the movie and then theres the tonebr br in the blessed original paul verhoeven knew how to direct with the kind of attitude where if you cranked up the attitude and the sensibility of a good pulp comic even the most repellent violence would be entertaining kershner although he did direct a star wars sequel doesnt and scene after scene either makes you cringe look away or just tune it out altogetherbr br and whats with robocop he should be the main thing here right but theres whole scenes where he doesnt even show up and what scenes he is in are so halfthought and shakily written that you dont know or care if hes parthuman or partcyborg  since hes allboringbr br never have i seen such a rapid fall from grace why does hollywood make such bad sequels on purpose why did the filmmakers have a bet goingbr br only one star for robocop  the fx are good but the story doesnt even try to match them
