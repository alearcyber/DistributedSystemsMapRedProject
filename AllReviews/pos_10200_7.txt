POS this western was set in  and had to do with the creation of the first transcontinental wireless lines that were laid by western union while nice guy dean jagger sporting lots of hair did his best to get this done there was a bad guy just waiting to undo this for his own selfish reasons so its up to either randolph scott or robert young to save the daybr br this is certainly one of the better s westerns i have seen and it nearly garnered an it was that good however for the life of me i have no idea why fritz lang was assigned to direct this filmafter all he knew nothing about westerns his forte was dramaand i guess this movie is a drama of sortsjust set in the old west strange yes but it seemed to work out okay though i wonder how this great german director felt about being given this jobbr br as for the rest of the film its exceptionalwith vivid color great location shooting and very good acting as usual randolph scott put in another relaxed and realistic performance i was surprised though with robert young being also cast in the film but it was a good casting decisionhe was supposed to be a harvardeducated easterner when i saw barton maclane was also in the film i pretty much assumed hed be the baddie and my thoughts were well founded since he made a career out of playing jerks as for the script it seemed pretty ordinary for the most part but the final showdown between scott and barton maclane was a lot better than id hopedmaking this movie ending on a very high note
