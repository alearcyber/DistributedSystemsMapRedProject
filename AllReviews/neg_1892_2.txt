NEG im not picky with movies oh ive seen so much crap i could watch anything maybe that was the reason i watched this one to the end im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is the securitycamera footage of a gameplay would make it feel more realistic than this movie does the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong in some scenes you can see that it was filmed in some photo when spoilers aheadpeople running around does not disturb people sitting near computers i mean would you continue your work if you got ninjas around you oh and the jokes about pirates thats the worst one yet in moviesspoilers end at least first one felt like a documentary now it looks like someones home video experiment you can find better movies at youtube top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes
