POS inferno gives los angeles what it deserves a baptism in fire death from above an excellent cast of obsessed characters could survive and sweat out the passing of the coronal mass ejection but that would be no fun and certainly not dramatic a really lame review in variety criticized the characters for being concerned with their personal redemption instead of banning together to save the world but whats refreshing about this big heat is that theres nothing anyone can do about it we are therefore mercifully not subjected to heart warming scenes of fascist presidents and other big blowhard statists as they contrive implausible plots to save a chosen remnant of mankind ala deep impact here the sweat drenched and lustpowered dirty half dozen work out their own redemption or face their personal oblivions the old fashioned way together as individuals oralone with the alone excellent tv film all in all clearly not denatured by the destructive meddlesomness of overzealous network execs i highly recommend
