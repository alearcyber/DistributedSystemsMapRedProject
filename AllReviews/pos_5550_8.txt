POS treading water is a very beautiful movie i would put it straight under the wonderful short movie  cosa bella from fiona mackenzie its not only about coming out but also about tolerance and acceptance in general i am looking forward to seeing more of laurel himmels work in the future the actors angie redman and nina landey are quite good the main characters relationship could have been strenghtened a bit as we understand there is a very strong bond between them but maybe this could have been explained a bit i am surprised that angie redman doesnt appear much in other movies a great first step as a director for laurel himmel i am sure theres more to see from her skills
