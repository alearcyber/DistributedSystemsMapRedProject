POS better than the original the gamers dorkness rising manages to pull off a funny comedy with good acting fine special effects and comedy that transcends the gamer knowledgebase and do so on a low budget ive seen many lowbudget films that have been terrible and almost none that have been as good as their highbudget counterparts this film blows most mainstream movies away parts are a bit weak the bit with the pirates and ninjas while funny goes on a bit long without explanation and takes you out of the movie for a bit but overall this is a very strong filmbr br im very happy to say that i bought this film as soon as i saw it and brought it homebr br any chance we can look forward to another feature gamers movie from these guys
