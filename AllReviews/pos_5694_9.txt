POS warning i advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this commentbr br this movie was on the shelf at a movie store and since i had seen a handful of very corny horror flicks there i had really low expectations for this one well i put it in and almost immediately i was sucked right in while watching i got deeper and deeper into the story and pretty soon i was staring in complete interest this movie is surprisingly spectacular and i loved every second the story is about a boat ride down a river in australia it seems safe enough until their boat is ambushed by a croc whos ready for some food when i looked at the back of the case i thought that this movie was going to have crappy visual effects like in lake placid  and a lot of others but when i first saw the crocodile it looked amazingly real dont laugh when i say this for i am being serious but this is one of the most creepiest films ive ever seen it really knew how to build up nailbiting tension and suspense with its intense situation i mean think about it your stuck in a tree nowhere to run nowhere to hide with a hungry predator in the depths of the water below you can not tell me that doesnt freak you out just a little it even managed to give me a few chills down my arms like when adam was taken by the croc and grace and lee are left baffled this is a very appealing movie there were maybe  or  parts where i found myself slightly uninterested but other than that i would say this is my favorite animal attack film that i have seen
