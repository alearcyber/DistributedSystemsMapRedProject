NEG i dont see the point its ponderous the animated people are creepy look up uncanny valley scenes go on and on and on for very little purpose the plot is skeletal and must be padded out with lots of meaningless dramatic screaming roller coaster rides as if disney or spielberg were planning an amusement park ride based on the movie most of the characters are annoying and unlikeable some of them keep showing up as if they will have something important to add to a climactic scene they dont they just vanish with no lasting impact somebody summed it up as if you dont believe in santa claus youll be kidnapped on a train on christmas eve that pretty much sums it up
