POS i enjoyed this show it was on in the uk but not at peak time and they seemed to move it all over the schedules so i wasnt able to watch them all i was surprised when it didnt return and had no i idea why still dont know but i guess thats not importantbr br great performances from the two leads they were very believable as friends the two supporting actresses also added well to the mix i guess it was part of a whole load of shows that were lifestyle centred friends being the obvious main one but sex in the city came along a few years laterbr br the characters get take out coffee they drink at nice bars  that sort of thing a little woody allenish in a way
