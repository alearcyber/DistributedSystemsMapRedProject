NEG first of all this movie is gross to the point of nauseating and my advice is to avoid it at all costs if you ever want to eat ice cream again i tried watching it because it looked like it might be funny but it soon became quite disturbing with the ice cream made out of body parts and surprisingly graphic effects it opens with a boy named greg witnessing the gruesome murder of an ice cream man greg subsequently goes crazy and grows up to be the title character by what appear to be mob assassins there is no explanation for this murder making it the biggest wtf moment in the entire movie other lesser wtf moments include the surreal asylum greg goes to featuring evil clowns a woman speaking in tongues because she has been possessed by the holy spirit what this has to do with anything i dont know and the fact that olivia holy crap has her career tanked this badly hussey is in itbr br none of these are good enough reasons to watch it the only reason is for the character tuna who is a skinny kid with pillows stuffed under his shirt so that he looks like a fat kid for some reason this struck me as hilarious i stayed up far longer into the night than i should have watching this movie just to figure out if there was some reason they couldnt use an actual fat kid for the role although i fell asleep before the end ive gathered from other reviews that tuna ends up losing the weight okay so they didnt have the budget to pull this off realistically suggestion to the director how about making the character not overweight br br thats it if the prospect of tuna has not interested you enough there is no other reason to acknowledge this films existence if disgusting horror movies about ice cream are your preferred source of entertainment check out the far superior the stuff instead
