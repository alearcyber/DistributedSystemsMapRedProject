POS closet land the title itself conjures up thoughts of secrets and that is really whats at the heart of this amnesty international film government secrets personal secrets both are integral pieces of this storybr br by far the greatest acting seen in too long a time both alan rickman and madeleine stowe were phenomenal in their portrayal of a government interrogator and victim respectively with only the two actors in this unusual standard length film it is instantly clear that both actors were dedicated and talented enough to pull the viewer into this tiny bubble of a world and shut the doorbr br a word of cautionbr br what isnt mentioned on the description of this movie is that there is a subplot that deals with childhood sexual abuse while there is no graphic detail about the abuse the nature of it may be difficult for some viewers to watch  especially given the intensity of the film on wholebr br im not a big fan of amnesty international films but this movie drew me in because the acting was so exceptional and i cant help but make this movie one of my personal favorites
