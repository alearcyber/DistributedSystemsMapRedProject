NEG i was sitting at home and flipping channels when i ran across what potentially sounded like an interesting film i like destruction type movies and decided to watch it i dont know why but i ended up watching it the whole  hours we have seen this type of movie i dont know how many timesbr br back in    there were dozen of films that dealt with global destruction of some sort the best one on my list so far is deep impact which was more believable than this one here are my problems with this film  cheap special effects like something out of the old computer  no background information or explanation on weather patterns if you are going to make a movie about weather at least have some decency to entertain the viewer with technical details  how come only  or  people figure out that the storm is converging on chicago no more experts left in the field  where are some interesting characters i truly dont care for anyone except maybe the pregnant woman i felt that there was no character development  no thought provoking moment what so ever and factually incorrect theme and this is only the first part of the film i bet the conclusion will show us few destruction scenes and a search and rescue operation just like it has been done many times before and judging by the special effects in the first part of the movie i can only imagine what we are to expect of course at the end the main characters will survive and life will go on how original
