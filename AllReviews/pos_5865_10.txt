POS i went through the highs i went through the lowscried laughed puked my everloving guts out but through it all i was made whole i became a better person for having sat through this experience in selfimposed degradation its not every day we can say that we have lived through the worst and come out the other side with something closely resembling our sanity whole and intact friendsneighborsunite and be as one now go out and find this film and languish in its extravagancies place it high on the mantel and kiss its polystyrene box take it to bed take it out with you when you go shopping or have blind dates with strange people they will appreciate you all the better for your sublime and uniquely schizophrenic slant on cinema and then they will throw their beverage of choice in your face but you will have the last laugh i ran for governor with this little beauty under my belt and you can too it is a treat worth having again and again
