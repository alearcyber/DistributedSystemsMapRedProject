POS the chemistry between sally hawkins and elaine cassidy was incredible they were thoroughly convincing and genuinely likable in their roles imelda staunton played the conniving mrs sucksby brilliantly despite the fact that she was a dastardly opportunist she somehow managed to have you sympathizing with her in the end rupert evans played the slimeball gentleman with sheer charm and snark he was a scene stealer the story itself was very unique as was the manner in which it was told the victorian england setting featuring two lesbian lead characters was intriguing and delightful there were some fantastic and unexpected twists and turns that really kept the audience engaged in the story a wonderful cast and excellent story made this film superb
