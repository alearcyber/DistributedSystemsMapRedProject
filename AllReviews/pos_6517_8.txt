POS this film centered on a young lady who makes prayers to help her family and friends when they encounter difficulties in life it made me think of other movies like the song of bernadette and francis of assisi and has a very strong catholic faith influence in the film ann blyth is very charming as first the catholic school student and then later as a young woman who buys a statue of saint anne which is the name of the street that i live on by the way and makes many prayers for the saints intercession whenever problems come up in her life frances bavier aunt bea from the andy griffith show and edmund gwenn from miracle on th street play relatives of her a local priest of mine used to say that my sister resembled ann blyth and the both of them have the same first and middle names a nice good family film that came from an era when life was a bit more simpler
