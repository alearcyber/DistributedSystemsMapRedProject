POS recent years have seen a number of biopics of famous singers and ray the story of ray charles has much in common with walk the line which was made the following year and told the story of johnny cash cash and charles were nearexact contemporaries both being born in the early thirties and dying in  both grew up in poverty in the american deep south both lost a brother in an accident during childhood both achieved success in the s both experienced problems in their marriages and both were addicted to drugs all these matters are emphasised in both films there are also similarities with ron howards a beautiful mind although that film was about a mathematician rather than a musician it like both ray and walk the line stressed the part played by its subjects wife in helping her husband to overcome his problemsbr br ray charles was born to a single mother in a poor black community in georgia in  his original name was raymond charles robinson but when he was starting his career as a musician he dropped his surname to avoid confusion with the boxer sugar ray robinson in some ways charles had an even harder time than did cash having to cope with two additional disadvantages in the shape of his blindness and of the racism which affected all black americans especially in the south during his lifetime charles had a particularly traumatic childhood witnessing the death of his younger brother george in a drowning accident and going blind about a year or two later he appears to have been haunted by nightmares and feelings of guilt over georges death throughout his lifebr br the first half of the film is rather slow moving and is a standard ragstoriches showbiz biopic telling the story of how the young charles is taught to play the piano becomes a nightclub performer and then rises to fame as a major artist falling in love along the way with the beautiful della bea the best scenes in this part of the film are the flashbacks to charless childhood there is an effective recurrent image of coloured glass bottles hanging from a tree in front of his house perhaps this was one of his few visual memories of his life before he went blind there is also a memorable scene in which the teenaged charles shames a prejudiced bus driver into letting him on the bus by pretending to have lost his sight on omaha beach in reality he would only have been thirteen at the time of the normandy landingsbr br the second half of the film becomes more interesting as it moves into more controversial territory focusing on charless drug addiction the problems in his marriage caused by his affair with margie hendricks one of his backing singers and his battles against racism in the early sixties charles caused a sensation by refusing to play in front of a racially segregated audience in georgia although contrary to what is stated in the film this did not result in his being banned from performing in the state he also fought against racial divides within the music industry itself performing not only traditionally black styles of music such as gospel and rhythm and blues but also traditionally white ones such as country and western regarded by many black americans as the music of choice of the redneck communitybr br as peter bradshaw film critic of the guardian noted ray is a sunny film which diplomatically turns away from the darker side of things it omits any mention of such matters as the death of charless beloved mother aretha during his teenage years his brief marriage to eileen williams in the early fifties and his eventual divorce from della bea in  it also plays down the extent of his womanising and the number of his illegitimate children there are similarities here with a beautiful mind which also omitted a number of controversial details about its subjects personal life including a divorcebr br fans of ray charles will no doubt enjoy the film for the music but it is worth watching even for those who do not know much about him chiefly on account of jamie foxxs oscarwinning performance in the title role reproducing charless mannerisms so exactly that we think we actually are watching a blind man even though foxx himself is sighted unlike joaquin phoenix in walk the line however foxx did not do his own singing doubtless charless distinctive singing voice was too difficult to reproduce he receives good support from some of the other performers particularly sharon warren as aretha and kerry washington as della bea the film is uneven and overlong but nevertheless rewarding
