NEG its important to keep in mind the real meaning of the phrase inspired by a true story when watching pride its sort of like you could save up to  which can quite literally be translated to you cant save more than  it all sounds great until you realize that the lower part of up to is zero similarly inspired by a true story means that someone heard a story and it made them think of this one the only certainty is that the real story and the one youre about to see are not the same thingbr br there is a real jim ellis that began coaching the swim team at the philadelphia department of recreation in the early s but i have a feeling that the real jim ellis must not have been able to conceal some feelings of disappointment at the way the movie turned out clearly it takes wild liberties with the story of his life and i just picture him responding to the strange looks of his friends who wonder why the movie is so much different than the man they knowbr br at any rate one thing that he will surely be proud of is that he is portrayed by terrence howard one of our finest actors who starred alongside bernie mac who despite the lack of an original and powerful story still gives a heartfelt and moving performance br br the movie takes place in s philadelphia a time and place where racism was the norm not the exception and the educated and professional jim ellis who is also an accomplished swimmer is having trouble finding a worthwhile teaching position until finally relegated to a falling apart recreation center which he is assigned the task of cleaning up before its demolition we can certainly understand his feeling of belittlement br br when we first meet elston the maintenance man bernie mac he is a disillusioned grump who sits in his office surrounded by piles of junk that touch the ceiling and watching daytime tv on an old dusty television set needless to say when jim shows up to start cleaning the place up and clearing it out elston is not exactly friendly with him he knew his rec center was being closed and all his anger about that transferred quite smoothly onto jim br br given his past as a college swimmer jim takes a special interest in the pool which he cleans and fills and brings to top shape a group of black teenagers who play basketball just outside the rec center take interest in the pool when their basketball rim is taken away and the heat remains stifling and soon the group have a developing swim team on their hands which they enter into a citywide swim meet to call them underdogs of course would be something of an understatement theyre unorganized unprofessional insufficiently trained and have no idea how to behave at a swim meet br br that doesnt matter of course the movie is your standard underdog sports story so the first athletic outing is totally unimportant as anything other than a learning experience a catalyst to drive their much harder and much more focused training that will lead up to the final athletic outing the one that matters by now the only thing a sports movie has going for it is that the protagonists do not have to win at the films climax we only have to understand the meaning and significance of their effort br br sadly the movie has all of the character development of an old seagal movie the good guys are the good guys because theyre just supposed to be and the bad guys are the nasty white swimmers who laugh and jeer and make racist jokes at our team oh and theres one scene where one of the white guys kicks one of the black guys underwater while in the middle of a race i didnt know it was really possible to kick someone underwater like that but you get the idea of how deep the character development isbr br we understand that this is the group of kids that jim ellis turned from kids hanging out on the streets doing nothing with their lives and into an organized and competitive team of swimmers but other than that we dont really get to know anything about who they arebr br but the biggest problem is that the only real statements that the movie makes are that effort and organization lead to success and racism is bad both of these are so obvious that when a movie is made with them alone it ends up feeling empty and unnecessary racism was so much more powerful in america in the s that it feels like an enormous loss that the movie dealt directly with that issue but didnt really say anything about it its sort of a feel good movie but when its over and you realize how much it should have said is much bigger than what it said the feelgood sensation turns into a sad disappointment
