NEG this is a very very boring and uninteresting action film and without chuck norris it would have been unbearable plus the low budget shows big time some of the fights were good but the story is laughable and there no menacing villains at allthe dialog was laughable i had some trouble finishing this film but chuck norris made it somewhat bearable i really have nothing more to say since i was only paying half attentionbecause it was so incredibly boring however it did pick up a tiny bit towards the end the direction is terrible don hulette does a terrible job here with lousy photography an awful pace and overall the film looked dull there is no gore the acting was terrible chuck norris is very good here he kicks that ass and he made the film almost bearablechuck rules george murdock is terrible as the main villain and very unconvincing terry oconnor is decent here and had okay chemistry with chuck michael augenstein is decent as chucks brother overall its quite simple avoid  out of  chuck saves it from the bomb rating
