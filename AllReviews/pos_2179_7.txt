POS well ive just seen buster keatons film debut in fatty arbuckles the butcher boy anddespite the crude way everything just seems to happen for almost no logical reasoni found plenty to laugh at like when buster orders molasses from butcher boy fatty fatty makes buster come back to pay buster says he put it in the bucket that has the molasses fatty dumps molasses in busters hat and takes money buster takes hat back on head as it gets stuck fatty attempts to remove it while molasses fall to floor busters feet are now stuck on floor and so on that probably didnt read funny but on screen it was hilarious as were some more slapstick involving flour being thrown and a later sequence that takes place in fattys girlfriends boarding school with fatty dressed in drag and buster helping fattys rival also in drag like i said many scenes dont make a lick of sense but the visuals especially those involving arbuckle and keaton are laugh inducing even today recommended viewing for keaton completists
