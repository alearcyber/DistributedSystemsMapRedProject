NEG screenwriter steve tesichs sophomore effort following upon the wildly overpraised breaking away is a compendium of clichs coincidence and dour melodrama perhaps he lived some of this if so im sorry to say he was inexplicably unable to dramatize any of it convincinglybr br in fairness hes not helped much here by arthur penn a talented director whos done remarkable work in the past bonnie and clyde little big man but fails to inject any energy or verisimilitude into tesichs narrative br br the cast struggles as best they can but are saddled with weak motivation and dialogue sympathies should be reserved particularly for craig wasson whose morose performance presages the impending quick fade of his leading man career as well as the embarrassingly untethered jodi thelen miscast as the films extremely unlikely femme fatalebr br it all seems longer than it is and any points made are heavyhanded and obvious see arthur penns earlier take on the subject of the s the droll and elegiac alices restaurant its everything this one isnt
