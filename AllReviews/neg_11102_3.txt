NEG my blurred childhood memories have kept the echo of the cult serie of belphgor in the french s so i was eager to see the big screen adaptation i should have kept my money and gone for a stroll in the louvrebr br the idea of the scenario is still very apt and interesting the fantom of le louvre but the adaptation is ridiculous the dialogues hesitate permanently between french irony and serious american business without achieving neither but not without sounding asininebr br acting leaves somehow to be desired and special effects are meager compared to what one could expect low budget br br what is left of all that not much outside a few good shots of paris  which is seldom a disappointmentbr br belphgor was worth more than thatbr br
