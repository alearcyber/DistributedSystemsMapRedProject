NEG this was another one of those shows that i watched to root out the positive elements and because ive been a nick fan for years some of those would be the stage sets bplots guest stars and a few of the main actors that were good i dabbled in the show through high school as i quickly grew to despise jamie spears along with the other chicks in the show that cant act the only characters i seemed to like were dustin quinn stacey michael  logan quinn is a perfect outcast that eventually started to fit in stacey is a complete oddball dustin gets put through a bunch of strange random situations and michael is kind of the comic relief righthand man of logan theres a remarkable difference between the execution  acting quality of the bplots that involve them and the aplots that showcased a bunch of screeching girls and an iconic miss perfect repeating bad lines and obsessing over guys this show would have been great if the main plots contained the quality of the side plots but the main plots just dont deliver anything when it recently came back in reruns and i tried to watch it again i was more calloused towards the girls abysmal acting and had to change the channel however i will give the previously listed characters credit because they did make the show more or less worth my time
