POS  contains spoilers br br a lovely film this starring brad renfro and the ever wonderful joseph mazzello i like joseph mazzello out of all his films ive seen to date ive loved every single one of them for many different reasons and the cure is no different brad renfro does very well in this movie as well the cure is a dramacoming of age movie from the viewpoint of an ill child and his friendbr br the basic idea is dexter joseph mazzello has aids he ends up befriending the kid next door brad renfro but eriks mum is very narrowminded illinformed and somewhat thick when it comes to dexters illness she thinks aids is contagious like the common cold so doesnt want her son going anywhere near dexterbr br after many attempts at making their own cure with no success the boys go on their way to new orleans to find the cure after reading a pamphlet about it after getting their kicks from playboy magazine dexters health goes south shortly afterwards and as his health detoriates theres still enough life in the boy alongside erik for two pranks of pretending to stop breathing unfortunately poor dexter does indeed die from his illness leaving poor erik behind to wonder why he couldnt find the cure throughout the movie he ends up bonding more with dexters mother than his ownbr br it is a very heartwarming movie to watch and is not absolutely perfect movies rarely are but you wont care less about that as you get involved in the film more a must for joseph mazzello fans one of his best performances ever very well recommended mustsee movie  if you can find a copy
