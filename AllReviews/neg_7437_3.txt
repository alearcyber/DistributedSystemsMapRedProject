NEG this was okay but really a bit disappointing because i expected more laughs considering the storyline and the lead actor bill murray it should have been a lot funnier than it turned out to be only part of this made me really laugh such as when murray lost control of his semi and was speeding down the road at a weird angle you have to see it to appreciate itbr br the supporting cast was anything but likable people just look at a sampling of the names matthew mcconaughey janeane garofalo and linda fiorentino yecch mcconaugheys role in here as tip tucker was just downright annoying he was the worst br br other that those people the movie had some charming moments but overall it is not recommended its another disney flop
