NEG straight to video and with good reason its like the neighborhood kids putting on a play in the backyard but worse a young mandon digiulio inherits a farm in west virginia that has been dormant for generations he decides to take a few friends to check the property out this farmland used to produce good corn crops even during the great depression the secret being that the owner was murdering folks and watering the fields with their blood then hang their bodies out as scarecrows the special effects are pretty lame and the the horrible dialog is full of unfunny oneliners and the banter so ridiculous the sound may better be turned off cheap gore and a sham of a horror flick along with digiulio in the cast jeanie cheek bw york booty chewning and jessica dunphy
