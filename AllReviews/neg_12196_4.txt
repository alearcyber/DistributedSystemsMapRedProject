NEG i watched this movie with no idea what it was about beforehand i was intrigued for the first whole hour it was shaping up to be a great thriller a very talented cast and good dialoguethen it all fell apart for me at the sight of the first vampire i couldnt believe my eyesa great thriller was flushed down the toilet the rest of the movie from that point was totally awfulbr br i gave it  stars for the brilliant beginning alone i think thats a little generous but i was entertained for a while im not a fan of vampire or zombie movies at allif you are then you may disagree with my opinion
