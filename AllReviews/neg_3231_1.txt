NEG i couldnt agree more the book is one of dean koontzs best novels and this film is a total travesty i watched about half of it then threw the tape in the bin in disgust i have no idea what the idiotic director was thinking making this piece of crap but i would rather poke my eyes out with a sharp stick than watch this useless movie again everything about this film is just wrong first the main character is changed from an ex marine to a high school kid why second the love of his life in the book becomes his mother in the movie hem i bet freud would have something to say about that lol the dog is cute enough and the best thing in the movie and completely outcast everyone else also a main character who helps them in the book betrays them in the movie there really is nothing good to say about the film except that at least its relatively short at an hour and a half or so if anyone hasnt seen the film yet do yourselves a favour read the book it is so much better than this worthless waste of time
