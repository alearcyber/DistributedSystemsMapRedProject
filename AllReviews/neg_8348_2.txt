NEG this movie is a disaster within a disaster film it is full of great action scenes which are only meaningful if you throw away all sense of reality lets see word to the wise lava burns you steam burns you you cant stand next to lava diverting a minor lava flow is difficult let alone a significant one scares me to think that some might actually believe what they saw in this moviebr br even worse is the significant amount of talent that went into making this film i mean the acting is actually very good the effects are above average hard to believe somebody read the scripts for this and allowed all this talent to be wasted i guess my suggestion would be that if this movie is about to start on tv  look away it is like a train wreck it is so awful that once you know what is coming you just have to watch look away and spend your time on more meaningful content
