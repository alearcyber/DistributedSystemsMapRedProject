POS i dont know about the english version of this movie but the norwegian translation is the funniest movie ive seen in many years the characters say so many funny things and make so many weird references to current events that im amazed they kept having more options like the architect who can never say the name of the wizard miraculix correctly it becomes things like malcomix and utenriks which is norwegian for foreign affairsbr br like the word utenriks many of the translations does not give any meaning in english and probably not in french either so the translators must have made up their own jokes and done so very well of course they have a very good base to build on with a film thats simply comical from beginning to endbr br recommended in all languages with a good translation
