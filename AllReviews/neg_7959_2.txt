NEG i am a big fan of deepa mehtas work especially fire and earth  unfortunately this movie of hers lacks all that is needed for a good filmbr br the movie attempts to showcase the plight of the widows in india in the early th century and the new wave of ideas of their rehabilitation around the same time shown with a child widow as a central character although the plot too banal from an indian standpoint it could still have been a very powerful movie alas the movie lacked both the sensitivity of fire and the intensity of emotion in earth br br even if one assumes that the story is a given although there are hundreds of things i would have liked different in that as well the movie making is especially unfortunate everything is said everything is shown straight absence of sensitive implied sentences absence of things left unsaid i just couldnt believe that this was a deepa mehta filmbr br there were some very standard hindi movie characters  like an old widow with her own vested interests or a father who has double standards of the highest quality can one not write a script without having these oldstyle standard indian movie charactersbr br many people acclaimed deepa for making a movie and proving a point against hindu fundamentalists well i agree that she took a bold step but should one not worry about the quality of movie or is it being a controversial one an end in itself its obvious that if you start with a story as in water you will end up feeling the pain of the widows in consideration  it doesnt take an accomplished director to achieve that and the movie had nothing more than that so where is deepas contribution to the filmbr br and talk about acting etc  pathetic lisa ray has a pretty face an extremely pretty face  but thats where it ends she cant speak hindi she cant emote john abraham is no better most widows seem unnatural the saving grace are seema biswas and the young girl they are fabulousbr br and this was a period film  but the hindi dialogues suck big time even there utterance is also as unnatural as it gets no rustic accents no local slangs no nothing the only thing right was probably the shooting locales i thought that the set of the vidhwaashram was reasonably real the overall blue tinge in the whole movie is also aptbr br but all and all dont watch this movie you wont get anything there is nothing in the story or direction if you have to watch it watch it for the little girls acting
