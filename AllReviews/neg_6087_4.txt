NEG how much do i love this film now im not a fan of bad films but i do love a film that is so bad its good this is one of those juan pablo di pace has a great butt looks fab on screen and definitely doesnt make a bad turn at his acting debut i believe billy zane is suitably mean and moody though i still constantly feel that there is something more in him i felt it in titanic the look on his face when la winslet spat on him for example totally broken shocked and putdown  fierce kelly brook is a pretty face  no seriously i think thats it its worth catching this to see one really hot guy some big bra fillers from brook nasty growling from billy laugh at the dialogue revel in the scenery and madness of the whole affair  im gona go watch it again now  yes i bought it
