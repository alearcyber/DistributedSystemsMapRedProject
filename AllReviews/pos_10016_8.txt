POS i was surprised how much i enjoyed this sure it is a bit slow moving in parts but what else would one expect from rollin also there is plenty of nudity nothing wrong with that particularly as it includes lots of the gorgeous brigitte lahaie there are also some spectacularly eroticised female dead bit more dodgey perhaps but most effective there is also a scifi like storyline with a brief explanation at the end but i wouldnt bother too much with that no here we have a most interesting exploration of memory and the effect of memory loss and to just what extent one is still alive without memory my dvd sleeve mentions david cronenberg and whilst this is perhaps not quite as good as his best films there is some similarity here particularly with the great use of seemingly menacing architecture and the effective and creepy use of inside space as i have tried to indicate this is by no means a rip roaring thriller it is a captivating nightmare like movie that makes the very most of its locations including a stunning railway setting at the end
