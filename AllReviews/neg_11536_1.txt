NEG i know when you buy a used oops excuse me previously vieweddvd for  you shouldnt have very high expectations but even that was a steep price for this poor boxed discbr br i will give the producers credit for providing a complex challenge for the viewer    to determine which is worst the acting the scripting the camera work the special effects    they all pretty much tie for just plain terrible oh it has the absolutely worst faked car crash ever used in a motion picture anywherebr br now all this is pretty serious ridicule for a movie fan who proudly features police academy naked gun national lampoons loaded weapon and a host of other campy discs in his collection but at least those folks know that ones tongue should be planted firmly in ones cheek the cast of pw unfortunately use their tongues in an attempt to deliver inane dialogue and although it is almost beyond my belief the movies characters seem to think they might actually be doing something of value a back room pornographer would be ashamed to release this messbr br oh    lucky me bought the worst video ever made at the same time  fraternity demon    maybe the name should have given me a hint
