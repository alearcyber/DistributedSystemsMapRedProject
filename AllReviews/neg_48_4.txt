NEG its saturday its raining and i think every movie should have at least one comment so i just watched the crime doctors courage all the way through its a murder mystery with a typical cast of characters and a couple of the usual suspects  each with their own possible motive for the crime the story starts abruptly and the viewer is thrown into the plot with no character development or storytelling whatsoever i guess thats not too surprising for a b movie of this period there are also some moments which look and feel like this is prewwii but perhaps that is due to the writers background in radio showsbr br the crime doctor is the sleuth who happens to be visiting california for some rr from his psychiatry practice on the east coast he hooks up with a mystery novelist friend with whom it is implied has been along for one or more previous mystery solving capers the novelist occasionally fills the role of sidekick to our sleuth aka dr watson and also occasionally lightens things up with a bit of comic relief sort ofbr br there is also a somewhat simple but not quite bumbling police captain who at times is annoyed by the meddling sleuth and then there are the mysterious braggas a brother and sister who are dance artists at a nightclub the dance is sort of an interpretive dance that happens to be one of those moments which feels more like the s than the s though the story location is california the braggas appear to live in a castlebr br there was one plot element which managed to keep me somewhat amused but i wont divulge any more than that because i always enjoy movies more when the story is discovered rather than known in advance even though i can think of many many b films which would rate higher and it is difficult to say that watching this one is time well spent i have not seen any other movies from the crime doctor series so i cant make any comparisons
