POS rickman is sexy and good but the stranger is less convincing  reedus is sort of sexy but he is not a consistent actor  this could be the directors fault in this case  we are supposed to find him alluring in the extreme just because he is pretty  but thats not enough the thwarted wife is almost convincing   years marriage and she and rickmans character should be more settled with each other whether their roles are to be incompatible or not  they must have patterns by now i get that although i think the wife is a bit stiff in her role  and not convincingly attracted to the stranger  so thats a failing  the unspoken bonding between the rickman character and the stranger is better done even if we are not sure what it is i miss rickmans sexy english accent luckily he slips into it and out of the american pattern disappointing but with some great acting
