NEG early jackie chan film where there is no sign of the chan persona we know this is chan in a full on traditional revenge tale of the sort that was cloned and recloned by countless producers and studios all through hong kong taiwan and mainland china its a very serious story that shows none of the humor and warmth that would catapult jackie chan to super stardom its also clear from watching this that had he not reinvented himself odds are we would never have known him because his career would have been painfully short as a film on its own merits this is a good looking but pretty unremarkable movie i was watching it in the midst of an all day marathon of martial arts films and it would have blended together with every other film that i watched that day had i not noticed jackie in the film honestly i dont think the film is really worth bothering with there are too many other better variations except if youre interested in seeing where jackie chan started
