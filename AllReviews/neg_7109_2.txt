NEG being a fan of marlene dietrichs films i was very anxious to see this documentary i also got sucked in by reading rave review after rave review from the national critics that should have tipped me offbr br the movie is just plain boring and obviously extremely overrated you dont even see dietrich she is heard in the background discussing her movies and this video she does almost nothing but complain about everything what a drag br br the filmmaker maximilian schell constantly complains himself and pleads with her to be on cameraall to no avail she just keeps refusing to cooperate after awhile this sort of thing gets really tiring with her attitude why would schell continue with this project he should have just told the prima donna to shove itbr br regardless of what you read do not waste your time with this
