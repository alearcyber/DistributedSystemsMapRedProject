NEG i saw this at my local supermarket and i knew that debra was in it so i decided to buy it out of support for that sexy woman the plot and acting in this movie was terrible with the exception of debra wilson and im not just saying that because i love her she seriously was the only actor or actress who had any emotion in their acting and voice what i didnt get at the beginning is why the wife didnt just get back in her car instead of running at random like that it was so stupid and its la nobody saw her being abducted on a public residential streetnobodyyeah thats realistic also in the park when charlie stole the womans cell phone for some stupid reason they were hell bent on finding him and at one point when they did they had him at gunpointover a cell phone in reality i doubt the lapd would go out of their way like that for a stupid cell phone the lady couldve walked up to one of many of those cell phone booths and have it replaced the kids acting skills sucked too i think they were reading from a cue card or had somebody off camera whisper their lines because theyd be asked questions and would look around and then answer in a questionable voice ieyes i do miss daddy also how could there be all of those snipers be in the trees and on building rooftops in la without being seen i see this being played at  am on usabr br debra wilson fanatics will enjoy her parts shes the only actor with any real acting skills debra sweetheartstop doing these cheap dgrade direct to video filmsmaybe thatll change with the upcoming film whitepaddy she puts some jokes in there like when one of her superiors comes up and asks her whos she talking to she screams at her computer and goes damnit charlie i gave it a a  only because of debras good acting skills
