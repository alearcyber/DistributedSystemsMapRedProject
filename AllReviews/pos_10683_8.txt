POS fans of gerry andersons productions will recognise several actors and vehicles from ufo which was made after doppelgnger  as well as sound effects from various anderson series barry grays excellent music mostly unique to this film adds to the feeling of familiarity for these reasons alone i think any gerry anderson fan would find doppelgnger worth gettingbr br judged simply as a film it has to be said that doppelgnger is flawed it is known that there were major problems during production and i suspect this is why there is a timeconsuming plot thread that ends abruptly and appears to have no relevance to the rest of the story presumably timebudget constraints prevented the relevance from emergingbr br distractingly the special effects range from outstandingly good  better than any s film that i know of  to disappointingly bad br br nevertheless even with these flaws doppelgngers main story is well told and keeps the viewer or at least this viewer engaged throughout the ending is perhaps not what one might expect from anderson yet at the same time it is typical of anderson and it is certainly appropriate to find out what i mean youll have to watch it for yourself
