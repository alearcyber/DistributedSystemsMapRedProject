POS its now  and  years since this cartoon first aired i havent actually watched it seriously or closely in about  years now that im an adult in my s i can look back with a serious eye as i watch the episodes againbr br in concept the cartoon is partly an homage to the classic looney tunes but also its own original show there are a few episodes that are structured like the old cartoons for example there is a singer that attacks buster and so he exacts revenge on this singers concert exactly like the old bugs bunny cartoon the ensuing cartoon is similar to looney tunes just in a different era if you look at the old looney tunes they did an awful lot of stuff exactly like tiny toons did the old looney tunes made a lot of social commentary and parody there were celebrity impersonations there were a lot of corny period jokes slang and dialog the comedy was surreal and wacky you can say this exactly for tiny toons as well the comedy styling is spiritually the same most definitely a throwback to the classics which hadnt been done well if at all in cartoons in the decades prior to this show we recognize the cultural references in tiny toons and we can roll our eyes when something we dont like comes up but the reason we dont think looney tunes are corny is because we werent alive back in the s also looney tunes was original back in those days but today cartoons are rehashed over and over so its easy to perceive tiny toons in an unfair light due to our exposure to current events and our overexposure to cartoons in generalbr br there certainly are differences in many respects  the timing the delivery and obviously the duration of the shows they are two different styles from two different periods being done under two very different circumstances  looney tunes being made for adults in theaters and tiny toons being made for kids watching tv even so they did a good job making an original show with original gags and still paying homage to and patterning after the comedy stylings of the old looney tunesbr br since tiny toons had a lot more time to play with they had some genuine moments of great animated inspiration you only have to look at episodes like  minute to  the baby plucky toilet episode there are so many more for example one of the best comedy dialog exchanges ever animated is in thirteensomething when babs and buster are on the phone in a split screen hoping each misses the other the miscommunication is spectacular notably the character development in this episode and in several others usually the ones penned by deanna oliver or sherri stoner is rather good the female characters were taken seriously as personalities and developed unusual considering the opposite is usually true for cartoons of that periodbr br this was the first modern cartoon that had lots of both pop culturereferential and selfreferential humor this was way ahead of its time tiny toons really opened up a door for writers to take comic liberties that are so common in the cartoons today instead of doing the boring old crap we endured as s kids yes i loved transformers and thundercats but tiny toons totally jumped away from all that it was a breath of fresh air bakshis new adventures of mighty mouse may have been a precursor but tiny toons made this surreal style of comedy cartoon writing a real successbr br as a kid i totally overlooked some jokes for example one episode is an homage to the marx brothers that i completely ignored as a teen now i have a newfound respect for it there are so many inspired gags that i never noticed that are genuinely brilliant its that kind of comedy that makes me think of looney tunes and family guy i never noticed that kind of comedy as a kid ive been thinking this for most episodes i watched recentlybr br youd notice these kinds of things if you actually watched the show unlike some other reviewers here who i know are unfairly judging it ive seen all the episodes and have thought about them thoroughly exposed both as a kid and as an adultbr br you can tell there was an awful lot of care taken with the voice acting too im not talking about just the main characters but the side characters were done really well and creatively too but back to the main characters some of the main characters were brilliant tress macneille had in my opinion her best performances in this cartoon she hasnt been the same since rob paulsen also did some incredible stuff here toobr br this is all not to say the show didnt have some bad episodes it had plenty it had a lot of mediocre ones too but by far it certainly had a lot of genuinely funny episodes especially back when it first aired it was actually funny to watchbr br out of  i give the show an   and kudos for pushing the envelope and breaking down the doors leading to a new era of cartoons
