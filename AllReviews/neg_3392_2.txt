NEG this dvd is barely  minutes long and has dull interviews that reveal that the average slipknotian has an iq of around  but these aspects are the least problematic herebr br the real trouble is that slipknot is one of the least talented metal bands to ever sell over  units of their crap the only reason i say one of the instead of the is because system of a down are even worse much like ed geins girlfriends this bands music is pieced together from ageold metal clichs which are to be found in both their image and their ultradull music in fact their image is kind of fun their videos are like snippets from cheesy horror films hence they fulfill at least some purpose as entertainmentbr br their music however consists of nothing of quality  whatsoever just a bunch of gimmicky heardthemamilliontimesbefore playedsolelyattheguitarneck riffs that are in no way related to each other and yet are randomly grouped together to form songs that have no cohesion no highlights no nothing but if the riffs are truly bad then the vocals are even worse slipknots singer has a stereotypical hence uninteresting evil growl  the kind  of all metal bands today have  but that is nothing compared to when this deluded hick starts trying to sing still what could one expect rule no of the nu metal handbook says quite clearly you will alternately growl and sing ignore the fact that the two styles dont mix well because most of your fans are so tonedeaf they will love you even if you  into the microphone slipknot are at their absolute worst when their singer starts belching out melodiesbr br but back to their image its stolen copied ripped off nicked borrowed taken without asking from none other than mrbungle youve never heard of them of course you havent you only listen to numetal and mrbungle is quite far from that and beyond any categorization anyway they too wore masks  grotesque horror ones similar to those of slipknot i might add  in the late s and early s this band whose frontman is mike patton from faith no more never hit it big because their music wasnt directed toward the average music fans to put it mildlybr br so basically slipknot arent even original in the image department they have nothing at all new to offer hence will be forgotten in several years once the masks become boring to the legions of their zitfaced fans which is when slipknot will be forced to compete in the music market solely with their generic musicbr br speaking of mike patton its interesting that a number of numetal bands often site his singing as a major influence predictably  and thankfully  patton is not flattered by this and has denied being in any way proud to have been an influence for one of the worst metal subgenres everbr br having said that enjoy this short dvd and the cheap thrills it might provide to the untrained ear and bored eye and then polish those slipknot posters because in a few years noone will be taking care of them the poor dearsbr br having seen corey in the documentary get thrashed i finally understand why he wears a mask he is a blueeyed babyfaced ginger looking like dave mustaines younger brother not exactly scarybr br for more of my musicworld rants go to httprateyourmusiccomcollectionfedorbr br please punish me hard very hard by clicking no below thatll teach me
