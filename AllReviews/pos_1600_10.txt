POS br br philistines beware especially american ones this has all the elements youll hate  a langorous approach to film language a painterly sense of composition an intense homoerotic focus to its elegant narrative a wonderful and unusual use of music and even worse its based on a story youd probably hate as well if however you do feel that films dont to have derivative plotlines be full of action and crappy dialogue dont need the visual grammar of mtvtv commercials then watch this its one of my favourite films and is perhaps viscontis most perfectly formed piece of work its sublime like the movement of mahler he uses insistently throughout the film
