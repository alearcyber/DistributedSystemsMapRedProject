NEG shut the front door thats what i said when i was told that blockbuster got a new movie in called snakes on a train okay maybe thats not exactly what i said but you get the point i didnt need to know who was in the movie or anything else all i knew was that i am renting this moviebr br i probably should have asked what it was about though in retrospect i dont know if i would have really wanted to watch a movie about a mayan curse that causes a woman to give internal birth to snakes and have them spit out of her mouth nor would i want to see a movie that features a guy who looks strangely enough like a pedophilic version of leif garrettbr br anyways while the curse might be interesting on some levels well maybe not there was still promise of these annoying characters getting eaten or at the very least killed by snakes so i was willing to sit through the first hour of very little happening other than a texas ranger forcing a girl into a nice little titty grope so she can keep her cocaine or the hispanic shaman that likes to occasionally stab people but then all hell broke loose and the girl started to spit out more and more snakesbr br spoiler alert so everythings going well at the end and im willing to overlook the fact that some of these snakes all of the sudden turned out to be  feet long after all people are getting eaten so its all good but then all of the sudden and im not going to tell you how because that would ruin the best part one of the snakes is about  feet long then it proceeds to squeeze and devour the train with all the graphic artistry of serpentaur from the old gi joe cartoons unfortunately i could not make a nemesis enforcer connection with this movie anyways so you would think that a snake that big who ate a train would be pretty unstoppable well not if you know your mayan voodoo rocks and have the ability to summon tornadoes from heaven yeah thats all ill say about thatbr br in short this movie is bad really bad to the point where you might be numb after watching this or your brain might hurt i didnt give this a one because no matter how stupid it was it still wasnt as bad as date movie so if you like camp or badly constructed b horror movies this is the one for you if you think this will actually be cool like its bigger more infamous brethren just walk away from the box if you see it and ill leave you with a quote from the movie that should basically sum it all upbr br snakes cant get on a train because thats just silly not like they make stops or anything
