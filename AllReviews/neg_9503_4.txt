NEG i thought this is an unbelievable boring movie i heard the director cant speak french and so he left his actors tell what they wanted well valeria brunitedeschi is great as usual but i cant say the same of other actors they have nothing to say especially bruno todeschinibr br they all seem very tired this being one of the movie plot  tired of being together of living abroad of their live in general so they spend half the movie sleeping in a hotel room after a while i felt sleepy myselfbr br i gave  because of some very beautiful scenes including the last one
