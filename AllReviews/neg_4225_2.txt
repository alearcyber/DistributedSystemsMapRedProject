NEG i think the cards were stacked against webmaster because right from the start there was this itchy feeling like something was wrong but i couldnt quite put my finger on it then it hit me dubbed for a little while they managed most of the lines either as voice over or off screen with just a little hint here and there until it became painfully obvious this is the kind of dubbing that grates on the nerves with nothing even remotely funny about it i hate dubbing but at least however misplaced martial arts films badly dubbed tend to have a sense of humour about itbr br what i wanted was a film about a hacker doing actual hacking and stuff like that maybe like a reverse side of the table of the movie hackers being about the person trying to keep them out instead about the people trying to get in what i got was some poorly written nonsensical at times murder mystery with a ton of bad chase sequences a supposedly inept hacker who was neutered without his little ego and a director who obviously didnt know how to handle a camera i just wanted to reach in there grab the camera from the guy and shoot the dang thing myself the editing wasnt much better the acting well i guess if the lead guy didnt have such a bad script to work from hed be at least watchable the main bad guy was ok too but pretty much everyone else was a joke dubbing didnt help but the acting was pretty bad even taking that into considerationbr br before i get into more bad lets perk up to a few good things well one or two despite the rudimentary graphics i rather enjoyed the cyberworld stuff what little there was of it and would have much rather watched a movie mostly about in and around that than the tepid surroundings outside in the real world the falsifying thumbprint thing seemed kind of cool but ended up being rather useless in the scheme of things the heart gadget which reminded me of guillermo del toros cronos was interesting though as a plot device ripped directly from the pages of escape from new york it was horribly conceived in the long run theres one point where the bad guy is unconscious and our hero is right there why didnt he try the bad guys thumb print then since the heart device was thumb activated nonetheless some interesting gadgets and cyber stuff if only they could have been utilized betterbr br now who here dares compare this movie to blade runner both films take place sometime in the future and theres some kind of off kilter type of romance in it sort of in both films theres the investigation of a murder but ive seen many a film with a murder at its center that are nothing like either blade runner or webmaster identity for instance thats about where the similarities end period there is no comparison just as there wouldnt be between blade runner and hackers ridley scott is a brilliant director with a great mind for art direction and knows some fundamentals of filmmaking like where to put the camera webmaster is cheap and not just because of the budget its cheap because of bad writing and because it more often than not takes the easy way out like writing in a character who barely appeared in the first place to save the girl in the end to get her to point b by herself without the hero so that he could do his thing very convenient or the attempted sympathy factor for a character we have no reason to care for or inane things like the car set up to stall them just enough for someone to get awaybr br it tries to be hip it tries to be exploitive it even tries a twist ending thats not the least bit surprising and it tries to be thrilling but a bunch of near identical chase sequences bad writing editing horribly shot bad acting etc does not a thrilling movie make
