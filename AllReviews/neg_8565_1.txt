NEG well first of all excuse me for the lame pun in the title i was browsing for movies to rent the other day and saw this i heard something about this so i picked it up and looked on the back and there was a short little review blurb on it from john fallon aka arrow in the head at that moment i thought well if he likes it then i gotta like it so i rented it and just finally got around to watching it last night college keeps me so busy oh and i might wanna add that i read a little of arrows review and it turns out that out of  stars he gave it  and a half so my expectations from this movie went from very high to iffy well after watching this i once again agree with arrow and turns out that quote from the review was the only positive thing he said about that wow did this film stink or what where do i begin with why it did so well the film was so dull in my opinion not even the cool gore bits excited me and when a decapitation doesnt excite you in a movie thats bad the characters i hated a lot and from the beginning i could tell who would die and who wouldnt actually the film proved me wrong at some points but the worst thing is that one particular character i wanted to die didnt what the heck and the chemistry between the main girl and the guy she met didnt feel it he obviously was just there to be eye candy and give her a love interest otherwise i thought he was a waste and as a horror fan i should know that doing the dumb horror movie sometimes gotta happen or else there wouldnt be much of a movie but the ones in here ticked me off hello why are you making out in the room of the killer nun when you should be on the lookout from her and it was done by the supposedly smarter characters no less the twistah it would have been alright if it hadnt been done a billion times and i didnt have to sit through this wast of film to reach that point my main point stupid movie that sucked me in with some words of my favorite actually my only favorite movie critic jerks
