NEG one thing i have noticed about british horror movies from the s is that they dont hold up to repeated viewing theatre of blood is a case in point as are all those amicus anthology movies  add the beast in the cellar to the list br br much of the drama of this movie revolves around the build up of a plot revelation at the end  once you know what the revelation is this becomes a rather flat film  it does open with a fairly good hook but after that were treated to long boring sequences of two old ladies making small talk  correct me if im wrong but how many people watch a horror movie expecting a couple of old ladies making small talk  the only sort of interest to be found in the beast in the cellar is the antismoking stance  some people have mentioned that this is an antiwar or antimilitary film but watch carefully and youll see that everytime a squaddie lights up for a fly puff he gets killed  rather strange considering attitudes to smoking werent nearly so hysterical as they are nowadays
