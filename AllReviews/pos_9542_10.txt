POS this wonderful film has never failed to move me the colour convincing cast and stunning scenery all make big contributions this production unlike the later remake by carlton is more impressionistic and presented more from the childrens own perspective it focusses on certain episodes from e nesbits charming story rather than trying to make a somewhat more documentary wartsandall style that carlton adopts above all the superb musical score of the late johnny douglas underpins the story throughout adding extra emotional depth the net result is a truly formidable combination of sensory experiences that cumulatively present the poignant story of the railway childrenbr br one uncomfortable factor for the viewer to ponder throughout this film is how things have changed since those times  and in many ways for the worse yes maybe many of us no longer have to use outside toilets and travel in horsedrawn carts but what about the quality of life in general consider the foulmouthed celebrities who now grace our tv screens their language is now apparently considered perfectly acceptable consider too the fragile here today gone tomorrow aspects of so many of todays partnerships plus all the single mothers  whatever happened to that institution called marriage when people accepted each others flaws but still remained together loving their children these details add extra piquancy when watching this marvellous filmbr br i hope that as generations pass children will still be able to enjoy this film not to mention certain adults
