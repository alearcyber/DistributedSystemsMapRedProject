POS it is difficult today and in the us to understand this movie we have nothing really to compare it with here is an attempt at comparison it is as if during the last years of saddams rule a filmmaker in iraq were somehow able to make a film which for the first time ever showed life as it really was lived in that country the life of ordinary young girl with all the terror and the repression full blown then the film was exhibited freely in iraq if you could imagine that unlikely event then you might have an idea of what went on with this film in the last few years of the soviet union prior to this film soviet cinema was highly censored soviet movies would only show an ideal life in the workers paradise then suddenly this the alcoholism the random sex the ugly wasteland that was the soviet city the choking pollution the proletariat victimizing each other and themselves the utter hopelessness  it is all there people were stunned soviet women would often weep during the showings many would say that this is the story of their lives it was a cultural earthquake the like of which filmmakers only dream of accomplishing it undoubtedly hastened the breakup of the soviet union br br reading the reviews here i can see that few understand this film one says it was groundbreaking because it contained real sex to the soviet viewers at the time the sex was a minor event compared to fact that it portrayed reality for the first time in soviet cinema br br others compare it to current films such as as good as it gets might as well compare homers illiad to the latest john grissam novel they simply do not compare this is not just a film this is was a social document and a transforming social force it needs to be viewed that way or you will not understand the film br br other reviewers see it as a film about a dysfunctional russian family one even says that it is difficult to feel sorry for vera because she keeps coming back to her family the point is that vera and her family are symbols for all of soviet life there was nowhere else to go because the family down the block and in the next town were the same this was life in the soviet union for most people br br this is a film that can be viewed on many levels as a drama it traces the landscape of despair as a social document it shows the living conditions of the time as a political document it shows the attitude of the people and many of the reasons for the breakup of the soviet union and as a moral document it shows the evils of a dictatorship that is out of control and the cruelties that victims will practice on each other br br little vera clearly shows the human toll that socialism eventually takes on its victims despite any good intentions that system may have in doing so it helped end the soviet regime thus contributing to one of the major changes in modern history this film achieves what only a few films have ever accomplished it is not only an stunning representation of history but it also become a force in that shaped history
