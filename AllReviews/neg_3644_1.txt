NEG i have tried to like this show i really have but i cant find a reason why anyone would like it the story lines are weak the acting is weak and unbelievable every cast member seems to have been picked up off the street at random and it seems to me that the whole show is just a vehicle for jamie lynn spears to be able to move on to movies every episode shows zoey as the girl that every girl wants to be her best friend and that every boy wants to date shes always perfect and no one is like that in real life how can people relate to a character that is just a barbie doll jamie lynns acting is fair but she is not a strong enough actress to have the lead role in a series all the shows fans are just young girls who dont know any better im sorry if you think my comments are too harsh but if you can find a meaningful and deep moment in this series that isnt quickly directed to a beach party  please accept my opinions and find something worthwhile to watch
