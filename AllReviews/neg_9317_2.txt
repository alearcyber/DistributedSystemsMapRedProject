NEG help once again paul schrader has sabotaged his own intentions with dull pedantic storytelling i rearranged a vacation so that i could see this world premiere what a mistake why did schrader even want to make an exorcist film lofty intentions are fine but if i wanted  hours of theological babble i would visit my nephews sunday school father merrins struggle with his faith as presented in his younger days is a potentially interesting subject but an exorcist movie needs more the relentlessly draggy presentation along with ridiculous special effects makes for a strange production who is this movie for i didnt bother seeing the harlin version but at least they apparently tried to deliver some sort of visceral thrillsbr br the exorcist series has been quite strange the first film was excellent but every sequel has been unloved and pointless why do they keep making them i suppose schrader made it so that he could get a lot of money but why should we go
