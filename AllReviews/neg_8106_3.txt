NEG mgm hodgepodge of jimmy durante throwing a big party for everybody in hollywood no major stars show upwe get the three stooges laurel  hardy durante and lupe velez i didnt recognize anyone elsethey were probably unknowns for good reason the movie contains annoyingly unfunny jokes and some truly dreadful songs and choreography the only things that save this from being a total disaster are laurel  hardys battle with lupe velez and a wonderful color disney cartoon called the hot chocolate soldier its a beautiful very colorful cartoon that gives the movie a huge boost otherwise the movie is a colossal bore theres no director creditedwhat does that tell you
