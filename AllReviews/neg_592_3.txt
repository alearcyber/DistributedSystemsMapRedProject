NEG all those who are into the pc culture are aghast at the dogmatic christian view of this film claiming it contains racist ideation andor religious intolerancebr br those who dont care about this but are oriented towards slick production values and competent acting are dismayed at the lack of such herebr br those who decry both of these are apoplectic that this production was let loose on the general public as evidenced in comments herebr br what is an interesting premise which isnt original but is a combination of ghost and from beyond is dealt with in a rather immature manner in this film yet done with gusto what the crew and actors lacked in sensibility professional abilities and technical expertise is somewhat offset by the intensity they displaybr br it isnt nearly as bad as many here think and would have been fine in the hands of someone with maturity and common sense and it is enough below mediocrity to elicit laughs and groans however it unfolds with enough intensity to keep interest throughout and is close to on par with a cormanproduced entry of his earliest period of work or the material of arkoff or sam katzman if you get it for  or less as did i you wont feel disappointed but will wish you could have had a say in how it was made
