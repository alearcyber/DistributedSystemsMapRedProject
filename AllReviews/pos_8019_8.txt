POS a very intelligent and exciting thriller that doesnt rely on action but on situation which is all to rare these days i would compare this film to the day of the jackal another film about the pursuit of a dangerous international criminal the acting across the board is superlative  aidan quinn has a tricky double role as the vicious terrorist carlos and as the navy man who impersonates him donald sutherland plays the amoral cia agent who hires him ben kingsley plays the israeli officer who assists in the plan this is a very tense and effective film and its remarkable considering just how little action there is in it the first half of the film is all setup as the navy man prepares to impersonate carlos the second half is a breathless actioner the action coming out of the characters and their situations thus making it all the more gripping a really tight film that shouldnt be overlooked
