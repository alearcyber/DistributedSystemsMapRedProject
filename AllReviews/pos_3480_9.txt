POS who could have thought a nondisabled actor could act so realistically and immensely powerfully as a disabled person in a film probably someone but noone truly noone could ever compare their expectations with the amazingly emotive and powerful performance given by the two actors in this filmbr br michael steven robertson lives in a home for disabled people he has cerebral paulsy and as shown to us right at the beginning he has huge trouble communicating so it truly is a lifeline when fellow disabled member rory james mcavoy who can speak normally understands him thus starts off a friendship that relies mainly on ironically enough communicationbr br in a hilarious scene they manage to move out of the home into their own after rory had been rejected good hearted michael put forward an application to move into his own house rory who already had a bad name with the judges was to be his interpreterbr br but troubles soon come about they begin goodheartedly stalking a girl who they met in a pub a while back wanting her to be their assistant to do the little things that matter she at first is reluctant she does not know these men but seems they could be harmless so strikes up another friendship but not necessarily a good onebr br as well as being poignant however this film really does rely on the actors but that isnt a bad thing for a non disabled actor you see rory though he can communicate properly frustrated at the way hes completely dependant on other people and has no real life of his own but the real star for me is steven robertson he acts with such emotion yearning to fit in and sadnesshappiness that really sees him win over the whole entire filmbr br excellentbr br overall  out of
