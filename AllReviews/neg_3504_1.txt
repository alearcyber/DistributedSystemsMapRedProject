NEG i wrote this as a two part review part two has spoilersbr br part  br br no this isnt that one about the sex with car accidents this is the one about racism in la you know the one where everybody is a racist and race is the topic on everybodys mind at all times racebr br its like the movie has a form of turrets syndrome where race is the constant theme race racist racism race relations relay racebr br paul haggis made a movie which took the structure of magnolia which was used to show the disconnect of people who are tangentially connected and then screwed it into a  mental vomit about racism in america race in the  hour period we have  stories running parallel all connected and about race the first hour people say ridiculous stuff and do absurd things in an effort to be real about racism in americabr br for example the story with ludicrous and larenz tate provides the comic relief too bad the first half of their story is lifted straight from the bonnie situation in pulp fiction racism their section is the quentin tarantino section where instead of being cool and talking about foot massages and religion the characters talk about race and racism constantly br br the other good thing about it is the mexican story when the mexican guy is talking to his daughter he gives her his invisible impenetrable cloak to protect her from bullets decent writing but thats only because the writers have had daughters and know what they would say in his placebr br the rest of the stories are extremely ludicrous the hindi does not act in any semblance of realism the scene where hes trying to get the lock fixed and the mexican tells him he needs a new door is abbreviated and stupid why would anybody act like that is it realistic nooo it reminds me more of the convenience store clerk from the doom generation six dollar sixty six cents girly if i ever watch the second half of the movie i hope his head is shot off and his bodiless head starts coughing up relishbr br i havent mentioned race in over a paragraph race racism race for the sun better then there is the black guy who wants to be white matt dillon who has a chip on his shoulder against blacks ryan phillippe who looks beautiful and does nothing and various other bad actors acting badly with bad dialog when matt dillon molests the black producers wife could i help it if i was cracking up when philippe is second guessing his writing up of his partner for racism can i help but crack up the movie is so funny when it is being racist racist racist i tell youbr br now mind you this movie was nominated for best picture best director best screenplay and best editing besides a nod to matt dillon who actually did attempt to do a decent job who was paid off for that one i have no cluebr br dont see it unless you feel like being preached at about the racism in society through a bad and unrealistic script from  white men over fifty who have no semblance of reality or interaction with real society in any way shape or formbr br d br br part br br the second half of crash takes any and all story lines in the first halfand spews them back out in a sort of redemptive conclusionary the world is a big coincidence kind of way and it is in fact one of the worst ways to do itbr br take s magnolia people werent conveniently tied together over and over again they were just connected in a strange way that happens more often than you think you know somebody who knows somebody who did something that you knew somebody else was also involved in crash takes this wrapping into a serious extremebr br the stories are lined up so everybody meets again are there only  on the lapd force arent these people working weird shifts dillon and philippe were a late shift then an early one the next day and why did tate have to be the murdered hitchhiker wouldnt it have had more emotional tension as well as realism if it had been somebody we had not been following all day long like phillippe just picks up a random hitchhiker and then freaks out everybodyd be freaking outbr br eventually in the second half the touching invisible cloak scene is used to get the hindi to shoot the daughter it ticked me off and made me feel dirty not that the hindi shot the daughter but that they created a beautiful touching scene and then had it be the direct cause of people tearing up it really ticked me off at the writers not the scenebr br the whole movie is fake and totally uncalled for the coincidences are far too many and they require an extreme suspension of disbelief unlike magnolia which was connected mildly this had connections upon connections upon connections which were just so overthetop the only good part in the second half was when sandra bullock falls down the stairs she doesnt die though she should have i cheered when she fellbr br the worst part about the movie is it pulls a magnolia not just in structure but it has a montage over the song in the deep where you see everybody being depressed magnolia took this and had postmodern commentary on it by having all of the characters singing along to aimee manns wise up unfortunately magnolia came out in  while crash came out in  its hard to make commentary on a movie which wont be made for another  years but it happened somehowbr br utter waste of my timebr br first half d second half lowest grade ever overall f
