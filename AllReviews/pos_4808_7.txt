POS running out of time rests somewhere in the middle of johnny tos cannon in the solid good category as a crime thriller its not terribly original or overwhelming and the action scenes will not blow you away but it has something else going for it its a johnny to film after all it has tobr br andy lau has  hours to live he decides to play a strange catandmouse game with a hostage negotiator of the hk police played by lau ching wan thats the plot in a nutshell on top of that to piles layers of twists and turns that keep proceedings interesting throughout it occasionally becomes too convoluted for its own sake but never lets it get the best of it however just as johnny to is about to hand over a slick and wellmade crime flick which lets face it are dimeadozen he slips in bits and pieces that bring running out of time alive as a full emotional experience providing the soul and heart to the welloiled skeletonbr br the concepts of synchronism and minimalism staples in his work are explored in great effect here always subtle letting the images speak for themselves giving them time to develop with long takes and slow tracking shots exemplary cutting to the score its all here a small love story in a bus between andy lau and a girl is among the highlights of the film and part of the heart im talking about so simple yet so powerful ditto for laus and lau ching wans car scenes and the bowlingroom showdownbr br however something stops me from claiming running out of time is a masterpiece to has all the ability and craftmanship down to a notch but he can also be too workmanlike or bland at times when hes good hes real good there are even isolated moment of pure brilliance that are just too good for their own sake leaving a bittersweet aftertaste for the rest of the movie im convinced that if he puts his heart to it he can make a really great film as it is this is another one of his films that is flawed but enjoyable underneath the slick hk style its the black humour and heartfelt drama that makes this a compelling film worth watching definitely
