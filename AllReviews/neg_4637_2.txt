NEG this movie has been advertised for over three months in greece as the biggest greek production ever well it could be but when you hear of a big production you expect to see something new something different what you get to watch here is a movie with no reason of existence george corraface looks like he didnt really enjoy making this movie his acting is so simplistic that looks almost amateur the sound especially when some of the turkish actors speak english dubbed is full of hiss the thankfully few special effects showing istanbul and athens in the late s and early s are more like digital paintings than computer graphics finally we see the same boy from  age  up to  age  but in a miraculous way he becomes a teenager five years laterbr br so much for the biggest greek production at least one would think that there would be some kind of interesting script to qualify for such an expensive production and all one gets is a love story between  yearolds who meet again  years later oh there is a political side too a couple of ironic remarks about the greek junta of  so childish that seem almost forcedbr br there are of course a couple of good things in the movie most of the actors are great mainly ieroklis michaelidis the very good scenery and the magnificent music by evanthia remboutsika but they are so few for such an expensive productionbr br bottomline is it so bad a movie to tell the truth i dont know i just know that in no point does it justify its huge for greek standards budget
