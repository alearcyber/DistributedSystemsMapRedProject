NEG shuttle iswas more than a boring movie that had an interesting start but after half an hour it ended in the worst imaginable way i ever could imagine this movie has lost its story if you can call it a story  after half an hour all the next scenes are totally out of proportion the driver is some kind of superman because he survives every attack with gun  knife etc even after stabbed in his leg he was able to put her in the box but what a coincidence that there was a box in that garage i really felt sick and misled when the movie ended it could have been such a great one if the story was far more better in my opinion even a kid would make a better story and why shipping the girl with water and food i quit with counting the plot holes about halfway through and when the movie reached its almost admirably sick overthetop final twist i had completely given up better say throwup the worst thing about shuttle is actually that it can not be even more worse that worse maybe writerdirector anderson will learn from this lesson and provide us with a decent thriller next time think the better hell move to a different genre i keep my fingers crossed but from now on i will read the comment on his future movies first before looking a waste of time
