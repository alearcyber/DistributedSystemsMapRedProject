NEG this movie was bad and the movies about how some college students stay at a house to get money by renovating it and then they find out that the house has a woman deamon in it and that there is a portal to hellin this movie there are heaps of stupid scenes like at the start of the movie how they are cleaning the house and they start to dancing to a cheesy song and some of the demons at the end of the movie are just some guys in bad costumes trying to make scary sounds and there are some good gore scenes like when the professor gets his face ripped ofi only hired this movie because i am a big fan of horror movies and its only worth watching if u are a fan of horror moviesthe acting in this movie is really bad the only good actor is roy scheider from the great movie jaws and over all this movie has heaps of flaws and my rating is  out of
