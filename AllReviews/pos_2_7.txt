POS my yardstick for measuring a movies watchability is if i get squirmy if i start shifting positions and noticing my butt is sore the film is too long this movie did not even come close to being boring predictable in some parts sure but never boringbr br all of the other military branches have had love notes written about them and seen their recruitment levels go up why not the coast guard too they are definitely underappreciated until the day your boat sinks that isbr br the movie was very enjoyable and fun kevin costner is perfect as the aging macho man who doesnt know when to quit however i was most impressed by ashton kutchers performance i have never liked him never watched any of his tv shows and always considered him an immature  well punk in this film he does a great job he is well on his way to having leadingman status i think the film we were shown must have been an advance rough cut or something because about  of the way in the film stock turned very grainy the sound level dropped and microphones were seen dropping down all over the place also at the viewing were representatives from the movie looking for audience feedback  particularly on the parts of the film we didnt likebr br possible spoiler the feedback i gave concerned a a couple of lines in the beginning kevin costner comes home to see his wife sela ward packing her stuff up and moving out he says maybe i should be the one to move out and she replies no you dont know where anything is in this house i should be the one to go this doesnt make sense if she knows the layout so well costner is right he should be the one to leave
