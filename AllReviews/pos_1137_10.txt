POS i saw this movie once a long time ago just once and i didnt know where it had come from and i looked for about six years to find it and i finally found it here at imdbcom just the whole concept of the movie is great i believe its got something to do with a race of bioengineered beings keeping tabs on us and our planet but there is one person who keeps out of being assimilated into conformity and the way that he does itto keep himself from being tracked and located is what keeps the movie entertaining i dont remember exactly how it ended but i remember it finished with a great climax and a good twist
