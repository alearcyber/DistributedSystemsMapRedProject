NEG i bought this movie at a thrift store months before my friend told me about it when we were talking about dumb movies weve seen once i spotted the cassette i knew i had to have it i watched it that night i could tell it was going to be very cheesy and cheaply done   thats what drew me to it i popped it in and i laughed the whole way through i recognized gregory the ice cream man but i didnt recognize his name and i couldnt remember where i saw him later while watching the andy griffith show clint howard ice cream man was featured as an extra since he is ron howard opie taylors brother i saw the credits and i gasped i turned to my mom who was also watching the show and said thats the ice cream man she too gasped this movie is great but only for laughs and criticalness it is the perfect example of a cheesy horror flick if you feel like laughing as well as poking fun at lowbudget movies rent this video
