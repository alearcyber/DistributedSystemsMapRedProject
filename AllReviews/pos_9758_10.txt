POS i cannot believe it has been  yrs since i first watched this story on tv i remembered to have been very much touched by it and was lucky to get the vhs tape several years ago i did not watch it again until just recently i have been watched it over and over ever since i must have watched it  times in the past  wksbr br the acting is superb the story is compelling and i am embarrassed to say that i did not appreciate actor bryan browns talent until now the playful facial expressions shown in the first half  when he gave jean the stolen medicine in malaya is such a contrast to his very reserved and nervous body languages shown in the second half in their first drink together in caines and the touring of the homestead we have to wait until the wedding reception especially the final dance scene to see his open display of affection for jean the same dancing eyes that first revealed his admiration in malaya who wouldnt want to be his mrs boong  br br while joe changed from a cocky almost bigger than life figure in the malaya jungle to a somewhat selfconscious average joe in his own backyard jean took the opposite road her wartime experience seems to have given her new confidence she wasted no time and went after what she wanted she took steps to take what she could get  exactly as joe had told her to once upon a timebr br for me all these transformations helps to show this is more than just a love story  this is a story about growth courage and fragility in life the solicitor noel is both a sweet and sad figure he too gave much to jean  he gave his last hope for love at the end he did what true love requires  he put her happiness ahead of his ownbr br i happened to like the fight between joe  jean that was not in the book i thought its an appropriate and necessary addition for it helped to surface the inner struggles they both had to deal with in order to make their life together possiblebr br now i am older maybe i understand life love and loss a little better this story touches me even deeper br br i am however surprised to see b brown has blue eyes in the promo photo shown on this site he most definitely did not in a town like alice well  yrs is a long time
