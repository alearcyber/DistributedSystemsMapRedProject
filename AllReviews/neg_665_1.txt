NEG after watching this movie i have nothing but contempt for any of those who were involved in the making of this abysmal film for one as a general comment the storyline was literally unbelievable and filled with incredible clichs all around the same obviously goes for the dialogue which panders to the lowest common denominator and manages to offer absolutely zero unpredictable original lines the acting was terrible as well with kane showing throughout the entire movie at the very most  separate and distinct emotions even the use of modern special effects failed as each prop was easily distinguishable from its real life counterpart overall i would not recommend for anyone to even think about viewing this feature as it will most surely waste not even  minutes of your life
