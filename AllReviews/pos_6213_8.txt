POS lets get this out of the way so the ones checking out this page looking for info on anything related to the word breasts and you know who you are googlers can move along this is not in any way pornographic on the contrary if this has any value as masturbation material then frankly the filmmaker didnt do a good job since the aim is to keep it on subject and on the experiences of women and their bodies and images of themselves and society and health and so on indeed i would be a little circumspect of one who came across this on dvd or if it ever plays again late night on hbo or cinemax and used it as a means for pleasure you might as well go to the supermarket and pick up a pair of ripe melons and take them home and squeeze them and uh well you get the ideabr br no this is semiserious filmmaking meant for premium latenight viewing but it shouldnt have to be just for the latenight types this is intimate in setting but not in tone all of the women in all their variety of shapes and sizes and races and even with one man thrown in with fake breasts have something of value to say from life experience in the most straightforward way if i say semiserious its due to the several little segments that the director feels she needs to throw in with the archival footage of old howto videos about puberty and sex and breasts and superrare cartoons with the knockers flying about this isnt a problem but an asset we need a few little visual segways to go between these interviewsbr br nothing is held back and we see it as feminism in a liberating form they dont need to cover up and even if they choose not to take their tops and shirts and bras off theyre still open as can be about a natural part of their body that is an object of sex surprise comfort discomfort curiosity motherhood and sadly cancer in that last part theres another brave step taken as we see a woman who survived her cancer with only one breast you know youve become mature and an adult when you can see this woman who has somehow gone on to live a seminormal life with one breast the most bittersweet moment is when she says if a fairy godmother said she could have one wish to have two full breasts she would have to think about it and you dont snicker or go eww gross thats the test folksbr br its not shot under the best of circumstances but then again for tv its edited with a tight pace its never dull for a moment and we never feel like anyone is holding back especially when a man might hear the hard truth like that breasts may not really be erogenous or that a flat chest is very attractive to some men breasts a documentary is about deconstructing myths with real faces and breasts and minds and hearts laid bare if thats worthy of a i was alone session then well more power to you i guess though its not the intention
