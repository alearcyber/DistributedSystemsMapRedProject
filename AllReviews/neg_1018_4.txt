NEG the dvd for this film is by alpha videoa company that almost always releases the poorest quality prints in alphas defense often that is the only print available but the specialize in public domain and cheapo films if you can find another print by a different company try it first as the print for this film is scratchy and faded still compared to most alpha dvds this one is excellentespecially since the sound is pretty clear and alpha never seems to include closed captioningseven with films with horrid soundbr br a man has been dating a lady for a very long time one night hes a bad boy and spends the night with another woman soon afterwords he comes clean to his fiance about this she forgives him and they marrybr br very soon after the wedding he gets a frantic call from the other womanshe needs to see him and has just tried to kill herself when they meet he learns that she has an std and she wanted him to know that he too might now have it then although there is a nurse there and they are treating her for the suicide attempt she somehow finds a gun and kills herself the makes a huge mistake he does not tell his doctor and he doesnt tell his new wife some time passes and now she and the baby are infected at this point the doctor meets with the guy and tells him about the importance of getting treatment and they shows him rooms filled with horribly infected people actually these were just films of people with stds that they spliced into the filmmost of whom have syphilisbr br in some ways the film is very progressive it addresses a serious issue and its interesting how the film encourages couples not to wait to get married but to marry fast and give in to those sexual urgesbut only with each other not bad advice at all on the other hand the film never exactly says what its talking about they never use the terms std vd or the like nor does it even name the diseases often it is referring to syphilis but at other times its talking about herpes or other stdsthe information just isnt very clear or specifica very common problem with such films from this era audiences at the time must have felt quite confused about what they were seeing and many of the more naive probably needed to have some of their faster friends explain it all to them br br speaking of such films in the ss lots of small and often sleazy production companies made films decrying the dangers of drugs and sex though often they really just wanted to promise a bit of cheesecake for audiences who usually could not see such racy fare in hollywood films many of these are hysterically funny since they are so overdone and the information so inaccurate the most famous examples are reefer madness and sex madness both by the same twobit production company and compared to how salacious and stupid those two films are this cheap film seems like it should be in the criterion collection br br interestingly there are weirdos out there i would definitely be included among them that enjoy seeing the films because they are often so bad and so horribly made that they are great fun this one however isnt that bad nor is the message that convoluted and the film of the victims isnt as grotesque as some similar films while the message really should have been more explicit and useful for a  film its pretty gooddespite the occasionally poor acting and the ludicrous suicide scene remember kidsjust say no to suicidebr br oh by the way the two years of treatment they talk about in the film was actually the norm for syphilis back in  nowadays its a lot more treatableas are the rest of the stds
