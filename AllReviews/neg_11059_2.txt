NEG audiobr br seriously ive never seen a movie with worse audio there are scenes where people are walking through the grass and you can hardly hear them over their footsteps they must be miking their feet br br you know how in some movies they forget a line so they have to dub it in on a shot of the back of someones head here the editors were not that clever there is actually a scene where shannon tweeds character says her line without moving her lips at allbr br im pretty sure for their background sound they played effects loops live while shooting because in a lot of scenes the sound effects will either be different or be absent whenever the camera changes anglesbr br i could write a lot more on how bad the audio is in this moviebr br other nuggetsbr br in this movie they probably consider the opening credits to be special effects because they seemed so challenging to produce the main title and the first few names in the opening credits are in white text over a white sky and they wobble as if they were carefully hand painted on each framebr br the reuse of extras in this movie is incredible there are about  rebels in the cast and yet in any given battle thirty or more of them will be killed if only the film were high enough quality to distinguish which ones were dying over and overbr br its also interesting to note that the rebels are usually killed by explosions that are always between  and  feet away there is one scene one scene when some of the rebels are running out of their huts in the rebel base and one huts shakes as the rebel exits the door it makes you wonder if the hut will last long enough to encounter the inevitable explosionbr br there is a blue helicopter that looks as menacing as a pair of running shorts but somehow is equipped with an infinite supply of missiles when they show the missiles being shot out of the helicopters missile bays the often shoot of in unpredictable directions very closely resembling large bottle rockets they still manage to hit their targets with ease which as noted above is always a very safe distance away from the rebels they kill note the recycled footage of the pilot pressing the live button to fire the missiles because its printed vertically the first few times we saw it we read it as the evil buttonbr br notice how the grenade launcher they use produces identical explosions to those that are created by the helicopter missiles its also fun in many scenes how the actor in the foreground is shooting in a completely different direction than the group of enemy soldiers that he is killing and frequently characters shoot a disproportionate number of bullets to the soldiers who are killed like when a short burst fire kills a large group of enemiesbr br yes this movie is very very very bad the plot was thought out almost as well as a  year olds soccer game and the editing is the worst ive ever seen but honestly sometimes its fun spend  minutes laughing at a group of adults who sincerely took part in such a terrible movie
