POS mcboing boing is one of the cartoons that have stuck in my head over the years and finally decided to look into it as was pleasantly surprised and was also surprised on the people involved with the production if i remember correctly we had to watch it on a uhf station and this meant using a converter in those days uhf not part of regular tv to tune in the local station to watch the cartoon a big deal in those days which made the show even more mysterious i remember all the sound effects that gerald used to talk a great memory from  years ago ill have to see what other memories might be hiding on the web by the way i try to do computer animation thats where the johnld comes into the picture
