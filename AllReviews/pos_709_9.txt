POS a film that deserved theatrical release this madefortelevision movie is a cinematic gem that exemplifies the technique of michael mann with stirring contemporary music tightly integrated to the visual images always with mr mann the amplification of impact by the music is almost as if there is an invisible academyawardwinning actor added to the ensemble of cast writer director and cinematographerbr br this film is definitely one of my all time favorites while nothing is perfect this film comes very very closebr br along with an excellent script great direction and masterful acting by richard strauss there is an allstar ensemble of character actors at their finest roger mosely brian dennehy ed lauter geoffrey lewis richard moll miguel pinero william prince burton guilliam jitu cumbuka richard lawson and billy green bush you may not recognize the names but you will recognize every facebr br if this comes on tv sit down with popcorn turn up the sound for an amazing soundtrack and score and prepare to be riveted for the  minutes of the film i highly recommend recording it since it is only available on vhs and dvd from holland and the dvd is region  encoded
