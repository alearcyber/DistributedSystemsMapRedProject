POS for those who appreciate the intersection of silent cinema and social commentary this is a unique film part homage to german expressionism part allegory the film is replete with visual symbolism and an artistic style that rivals anything seen since the s moreover the attention to period detail and the visual composition of the scenes as an instrument for advancing the story is stunning aside from this the plot offers an interesting commentary on the role of the media in society and its effect on social voice perception and opinion in truth its not so much the silence that permeates the film as it is the loss of voice and the loss of words to communicate and express thought that inevitably follows in sum this film is something not often seen and as the producer of the film said in the qa that followed will leave you thinking about its meaning well into the next day
