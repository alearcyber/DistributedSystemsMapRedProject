POS this movie shows that the free enterprise system and the quest for the almighty buck transcends all racial and ethnic barriers ultimately the market place determines the message that is sent to the public this movie dramatizes that point a conservative whitecollar advertising company is taken over by a group of streetwise african americans chaired by a nononsense black man who wants to make a buck and believes he can sell products by telling the the truth but the movie shows that no matter how hard he tries to do something different the market place and the political system demands that he conform rendering him no different than his predecessors interesting offbeat movie
