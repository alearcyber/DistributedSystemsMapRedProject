POS i recently rented this movie as part of a nostalgic phase im going through i was born in  and so film from mids to mids has quite an important place in my growing upbr br this particular movie was one of my favourites and so i was thrilled when it became available in the uk it hasnt become worse with time it is still a great fun film with plenty of excitement in its own way sure it pales in the shadow of bigger larger budget films but dont let that stop you enjoying thisbr br worth a rent or even a purchase at the discount prices youll find it for
