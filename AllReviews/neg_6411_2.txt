NEG the goodbr br carrey is good actor and he proved it in man on the moon and in eternal sunshine of the spotless mind but hey what can an actor do without good story and proper directing he can do number br br the bad br br joel schumacher is poor overrated director and he proved it in almost every movie he made what he did with batman is just disaster but probably batman movies supposed to look good well they didnt instead of gothic and macabre we got disneyland sure falling down was great but can you ruin the film with robert duvall and michael douglas and with excellent script no you cant br br and so good actor and poor director finally met and made number br br the ugly br br i know that its stupid to begin with but fingerlings subplot almost half of this movie looks exactly like intro to another chapter of max payne voiceovers quality of detective story itself quality of the characters even colors mood and music editing and sound mix too perhaps it works for the game but surely it doesnt in the cinemabr br mise en scene is so bad that it becomes funny its not even annoying carrey reads walking down the stairs in park why is it natural no but it looks good why suicide blond covered walls in her apartment with white paper if she just wanted to kill herself there is no logic in that but still it looks good guess what it it doesnt look good at all it looks unnatural instead br br all female characters are flat why is that so who cares lets go on with the storybr br who is this fingerling private eye on the suicide hardly believablebr br scenes when walter sparrow is arguing with his wife about weather book is really about him could be the best part of this movie instead we get moulderscully routine disappointment br br interiors has no sign of people living in them except the significant objects shoes photos etc hard luckbr br dialogs aint that bad but what about vo well thats another story theres no such thing as destiny there are only different choices captain obvious to the rescue number was coming after fingerling and now it was coming after me clich and so onbr br its obvious that average housewife would break into public building in the middle of the night successfully and undisturbedbr br the subplot of the dog dragging main character to the graveyard this is so old trick and so comfortable for writer and that it should have been banned i mean itbr br flashbacks and editing similar to what happened in last episode of xfiles isnt the best way to present the most interesting part of the movie is itbr br i wish i could say that this story deserves a better fate but it doesnt it makes no sense told in chronological order is weak and unbelievable all the time we have undeveloped characters trapped is chain of situations which are nothing but badly written fiction this could be fun but  since whole movie is dead serious  it isnt to many coincidences is just bad for every story and the mystery its predictable and easy to guess br br losing touch with reality is great theme for good movie but i never saw any of that in hollywoods productions if youre interested in the subject just watch repulsion by polanski or something by david cronenberg spider or a history of violence both of that movies deals with similar problems that number  wanted to show wanted but failed
