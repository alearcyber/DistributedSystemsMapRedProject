POS i really liked the first part of this film in africa for about an hour or so until the animal cruelty by civilized humans in scotland got to me in the second half and made me so sad i couldnt watch some of it however this was done by the filmmaker to make a point that early natural scientists ruined everything alive they didnt understand by studying it literally to death without considering the rights and comfort of the animals studied which we know now shouldnt be studied anywhere but in the natural world they inhabit and as unobtrusively as possible i do recommend this film as it was a mostly serious and honest story of tarzan and made a point of showing the gross animal cruelty that was rampant in the th century scientific world as well as the pure and simple beautifully primitive life tarzan lived as a young man who was found as a baby and raised by chimps after the violent death of his parents in the african junglebr br christopher lambert was wonderful and very soulful in his life of tarzan role as was ralph richardson in his last film role as tarzans ultrarich nobilityreeking gramps in scotland andy macdowell was pretty and pretty good as tarzans gussiedup and civilized jane in her first movie role from his charismatic work in this film and his very haunting eyes i cannot understand why lambert did not later become a big star but his really bad movie choices later may have done him in the terrific ian holm as a wounded frenchman in africa helped by tarzan and who then escorted tarzan back to his previously unknown ancestral home in scotland was great as alwaysbr br i am so glad tarzan got sick of and didnt stay in the animalcruel civilized world at that time and went home to africa in the end to live out his life with his gentle and loving ape relatives who raised him instead of staying in scotland and living like royalty which would have ruined him if it didnt kill him first
