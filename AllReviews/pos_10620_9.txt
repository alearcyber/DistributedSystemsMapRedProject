POS i have seen this movie just once and im looking forward to see it again and again dear david from beligium why did you bother to write a comment on this movie i only think we can think about you after reading you comment is that youre provably a nonsexual person like erika in the movie and you are not ready for the new cinema that is coming up i guess you are a bit old and sexual expression is not part of your visage the cannes film festival is by far the best movie festival and im is my pleasure to say that this film was awarded with best actress best actor and grand prix isabelle huppert is magnificent as always who would do this movie like her one of her best performances ever the music is fantastic and once more michael haneke puts reality in the big screen its like a dogma kind of movie because of the topic try to see itbr br
