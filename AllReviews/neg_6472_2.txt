NEG this remake is entitled that darn cat but dc the cat is more of a sideline than the major character patti randall was not likable at all in this remake either she reminded me of one of those high school goth jerks you read about who have been angry since the day they were born so they end up opening fire on the rest of the school one day the federal cop kelso was okay but not as good as the one in the original i guess disney was trying to make christina ricci and doug doug or whatever goofy name he has into stars but they dont hold a candle to hayley mills and dean jones in the original im an animal lover and a cat lover and i dont blame dc for the remake being so much more inferior to the original movie after all they nearly cut him out of the whole movie all in all a very poor remake
