NEG pretentious storytelling such as this always uses the same technique  throw opaque unstructured threads around to perplex the audience  deal only in big topics such as life death and god  make it appear profound with scenes of life death sky etc  depend on an intellectually weak audience to give you the benefit of the doubt  and finally laugh all the way to critical acclaimbr br this movie is pretentious fauxintellectualism at its boldest not only do these filmmakers not answer any questions theyre afraid to pose the questions to begin with the film is held together by wisps directions are raised and dropped awkwardly pop cultural references are jolting and arbitrary there is so little to point at that any critical stabs will missbr br critics who found an intellectual base to this movie are afraid to admit the truth they have no idea what this movie is about good news neither do the filmmakers satisfying attempts at answers to profound questions about human existence demand wit intellect poetry and genius sadly this movie demonstrates none of these traits
