POS i have not seen a better comedy than the king of queens for many years i rate it one of the best ever ive just returned to ireland from arizona on american airlines from a biz trip and by chance they showed several episodes i laughed my head off and later i asked the stewards to play again and they did thank you aa the acting from all the team is first rate and especially from kevin james leah remini and gerry stiller but from all of the cast in fact the acting is superb i love all the cast they are so funny there is a hard edge in the king of queens that i love and is seldom seen in todays tv comedy both leah and kevin play off each other so well that every situation is believable and hilariously funny i have just purchased the nd season while i was in az this week and i intend buying the full set the next time i am in the us my son who is yrs old also loves this show and its brilliance is that it has the magic to reach out to different generations i would like to thank all those involved with this amazing show  its so appreciated to see this kind of tv show in what is in my opinion an era of poor tv fair in general these days with the exception of reruns of seinfeld and such like thanks for a great show
