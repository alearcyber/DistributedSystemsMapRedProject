NEG ridiculous film where two swinging college graduates move out to california and one becomes a movie star and the other his managerbr br as  years pass the stars popularity is decreasing so it is determined that there will be a television show where women will compete for his affection br br the film is obnoxious and ridiculous the girls who vie for lover boy are made to look foolish only one girl seems to be the choice of the producer of the show she is really an amateur up against some of the other women but she is wholesome and brings good ratings to the show as wellbr br by the third scene you realize that the manager is falling for herbr br we know that ryan really was meant to be a bachelor while the ending is somewhat cute you really know where this was going
