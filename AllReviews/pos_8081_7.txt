POS i like the phrase british post war suburban paranoia that one of the reviewers used it describes so well the kind of films john mills excelled in the october man  the long memory  in between big pictures scott of the antartic  and war and peace br br this distinctly eric ambler style plot had john mills playing dr howard latimer who promises his friend charles unseen to meet a visiting german actress frieda veldon lisa daniely at the airport a creepy reporter jeffrey windsor lionel jeffries is in his consulting rooms at the time and offers to give him a lift but while he is tracking the actress down windsor informs him she is already in the car waiting something fishy is going on howard is dropped off for his date and thinks no more about itbr br the next night he finds her body when he arrives home from work further more he finds his friend charles could not have rung him as he is still in new york and windsor doesnt seem to exist earlier on a patient mrs amblerrene ray who has been referred to him by doctor george kimber mervyn johns tells of her recurring dream about finding a dead body and a brass candlestick with a square base it is a nightmare that is coming true for howard but of course when detective inspector dane roland culver interviews her she denies all knowledge of the conversation  the candlestick is later found in the boot of howards daimlerbr br when howard is lying low robert brady wilfred hydewhite visits him he calls himself a friend  he has a photo of windsor that he wants to trade for a box of matches frieda gave howard at the airport howard returns to the flat charles rings and while howard is on the phone an unknown assailant knocks him out and steals the matches who can he trust  who hasnt something to hidebr br this is a top thriller  not quite in the same class as the october man but with john mills doing what he does best  playing ordinary men caught up in impossible mysteriesbr br highly recommended
