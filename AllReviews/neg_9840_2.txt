NEG nicodemus is almost a copy of red in the odd behavior sense but this episode focuses on other people in clark kents unpredictable life when a poisonous flower finds its way into smallville jonathan kent is the first to be effected by it the flower causes people to reverse their behavior and when it effects jonathan he becomes short tempered and violent however clark manages to stop him from doing anything rash until his father finally passes out okay so far so good next up is lana the episode was good up to that point for the flower causes her to attempt seducing clark at the last moment he refuses her but the damage has already been done this episode causes the wrong impressions and isnt suitable for people under the age of twenty due to its adult content the first part was good the last part focusing on the effect the flower has on pete was good but the middle that was all about lanas alternate personality was most defiantly not and that ruined what could have been a brilliant episode i give this episode two
