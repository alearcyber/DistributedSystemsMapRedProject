POS well im a few days late but what the hell anyways the word that best describes my reaction to see no evil wassurprise the film is actually pretty good there is definitely an ample amount of blood gore  action in the film with a modest amount of suspense it hearkens back to the good ole slasher days of the late s  early s think madman meets leatherface with a dash of norman bates and youll get a good feel for this flick while sne is thin on plot most horror films are it kind of makes up for it in the violencemethods of killing the gore suspense  the fact that kane does a great job of playing the highly disturbed jacob goodnight the title of the film comes from the fact that jacob plucks out the eyes of his victims using just his fingers  stores them in big jars why youll just have to watch it  see pun intended there are certain cinematic elements lifted from other horror films most notably psycho tcm  madman but theyre not blatant finally sne really doesnt go into territory we long timers havent seen before  granted sne is no pyscho or tcm  but it certainly merits a look imo br br bloodstones recommendation take in a matine showing of see no evil bloodstones rating
