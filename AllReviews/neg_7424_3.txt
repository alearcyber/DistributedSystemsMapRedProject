NEG a plane carrying employees of a large biotech firmincluding the ceos daughtergoes down in thick forest in the pacific northwest when the search and rescue mission is called off the ceo harlan knowles lance henriksen puts together a small ragtag group to execute their own search and rescue mission but just what is knowles searching for and trying to rescue and just what is following and watching them in the woods br br oy what a mess this film was it was a shame because for one it stars lance henriksen who is one of my favorite modern genre actors and two it could have easily been a decent film it suffers from two major flaws and theyre probably both writerdirector jonas quastels faultthis film which ill be calling by its aka of sasquatch has just about the worst editing ive ever seen next to alone in the dark  and quastels constant advice for the cast appears to have been okay lets try that again but this time i want everyone to talk on top of each other improvise nonsequiturs and generally try to be as annoying as possiblebr br the potential was there despite the ripoff aspects any material related to the plane crash was obviously trying to crib the blair witch project  and any material related to the titular monster was cribbing predator  ed woodlike exposition and ridiculous dialogue the plot had promise and potential for subtler and far less saccharine subtexts the monster costume once we actually get to see it was more than sufficient for my tastes the mixture of character types trudging through the woods could have been great if quastel and fellow writer chris lanning would have turned down the stereotype notch from  to at least  and spent more time exploring their relationships the monsters lair had some nice production design specifically the corpse decorations ala a more primitive jeepers creepers  if it had been edited well there were some scenes with decent dialogue that could have easily been effectivebr br but the most frightening thing about sasquatch is the number of missteps made for some reason quastel thinks its a good idea to chop up dialogue scenes that occur within minutes of each other in real time so that instead we see a few lines of scene a then a few lines of scene b then back to a back to b and so onbr br for some reason he thinks its a good idea to use frequently use black screens in between snippets of dialogue whether we need the idea of an unspecified amount of time passing between irrelevant comments or whether the irrelevant comments seem to be occurring one after the other in time anywaybr br for some reason he doesnt care whether scenes were shot during the morning afternoon middle of the night etc he just cuts to them at random for that matter the scenes were shown appear to be selected at random important events either never or barely appear and were stuck with far too many pointless scenesbr br for some reason he left a scene about cave art in the film when it either needs more exposition to justify getting there or it needs to just be cut out because its not that important the monsters intelligence and humanity could have easily been shown in another waybr br for some reason there is a whole charactermary mancinileft in the script even though shes superfluousbr br for some reason we suddenly go to a extremely softcore porno scene even though the motif is never repeated againbr br for some reason characters keep calling harlan knowles mr h like theyre stereotypes of asian domesticsbr br for some reason quastel insists on using the blurry cam and distortocam for the monster attack scenes even though the costume doesnt look that bad and it would have been much more effective to put in some fog a subtle filter or anything else other than bad cinematographybr br i could go on but you get the ideabr br i really wanted to like this film better than i didim a henriksen fan im intrigued by the subject i loved the setting i love hiking and this is basically a hiking film on one levelbut i just couldnt every time i thought it was going to be better from this point until the end quastel made some other awful move in the end my score was a  out of
