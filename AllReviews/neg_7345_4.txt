NEG the story is shortly about the faithlacking business man priest daniel clemens christian slater who is looking closer on a case where another priest is suspected for murder the priest denies hes guilty but at the same time he is not able to discuss the matter due to confidentiality enter daniel clemens who starts playing copbr br while the plot isnt ridiculous everything else is lets start with the visual side the cinematography is dull it looks more like a tvseries than a movie the camera angles are boring in fact theres not a single memorable camera angle in the entire movie theres no interesting closeups revealing details and the scene transitions well theres not much to say about those they arent smooth at all there seems to be no connection between the scenes than the actual plot okay they did use a transition with music in between two scenes but there are no interesting visual transitions in the entire movie the times dissolve was used there was no visual connection between the scenesbr br the boring visual part could be forgiven if the film would offer anything else unfortunately the film only offers forced wooden acting and clumsy dialogue with no punch on top of that the film suffers from audio problems the sound volume is lowered several times in the movie as if the microphones would be too farbr br i didnt predict the solution of the film it could be because the film never gave me the opportunity or it could be due to the presentation which was so boring i never even tried to figure it outbr br put two plus two together and it equals a bmovie where b stands for boring
