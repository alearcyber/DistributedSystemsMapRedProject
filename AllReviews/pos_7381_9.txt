POS this film noire set piece suffers from murky sound at least as shown on the inadequate equipment of both the seattle and maine film festivals and murkier plotting while rickman suffers from an american accent old tennis shoes and baggy sweats nonetheless he has moments of stellar scenery chewing and the film offers sinister ambiguity from norman reedus the pretty polly walker and a surprise ending telescoped to frequent filmgoers while affording a beautiful look at the physiography of both maine and rickman due out in video release after a cable airing in march not to be missed by any rickman fan ignore the amanita hooey
