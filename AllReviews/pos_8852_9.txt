POS john carpenters brilliantly suspenseful flick is a great fusion of scifi and horror adopting the classic bodyswap theme and taking it to the extreme a remake of the howard hawks produced  original carpenter keeps the coldwar themes of paranoia and trust as a backdrop of alien takeover and impending doom amidst madness and the isolation of the antarctic setting carpenters direction as always is excellent as his camera glides through the lonely world of the characters whose inhabitable environment is about to be corrupted by the primordial fear of body takeover but here and much like the work of david cronenberg carpenter doesnt hold back on the incident as through some fantastic special effects we are witness to some insane moments of surreal gore however he never loses touch with the human side of the story as in the face of everything shocking happening in front of us we are left with perceived notions of trust and suspicionbr br
