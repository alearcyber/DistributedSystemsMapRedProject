POS theres a good running bit about the price tag of a silk negligee the bimbo in the office shows off the bargain she got for  closeup of tag later mary astor finds the tag in the bosss bedroom proof that bimbo slept with him still later mary astor is about to have an affair with ricardo cortez looks at the price tag of her silk negligee  and is reminded of how disgusted she was about the bimbo as well as the fact that shes spent  less than the most obvious woman shes ever met it sounds an obvious morality turn but it was well done the film would be stronger if robert ames character had been played by a more powerful actor hes too lowkey for a selfmade salesman and he spends most of the film with his face turned away from the camera and if ricardo cortez had been given more to do than smile ironically both male leads are bland and forgettable and are hindered by the pancake male makeup so popular in this films era however the mary astor character is interesting appealing and believable behind closed doors is well worth seeing
