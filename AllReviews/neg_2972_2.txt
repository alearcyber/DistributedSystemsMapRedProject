NEG hollywood has made a lot of strange movies over the years but none stranger than this why this movie got made i will never know nor how paramount could have thought it would sell any tickets in  it is the strangest mix of genres i have seen in a long time a movie that truly does not know whether it is trying to be a serious war drama or a viennese operetta comedybr br it tells the story of a british spy trying to get a poison gas formula out of germany in the days just before ww ii began ray milland a fine actor is stuck playing the part like an escapee from monty python all very exaggerated english prepschool dialogue in germany he meets a gypsy marlene dietrich who helps him to travel under cover as of course another gypsy she plays her part like the typical viennese operetta gypsy caricature as do the other gypsies in the movie but there are also nazis who are not funny at all and then milland finds he is starting to think like a gypsy and that is not treated as a joke sometimes the music is for a light comedy sometimes for a drama every time the nazis show up the film score plays wagner which is funny by itselfbr br this movie could have been a comedy or it could have taken the plight of the gypsies seriously and done a serious job of showing how the nazis treated them both are hinted at in this movie but neither pursued what we are left with is a truly strange mishmash of genres that must have embarrassed everyone except the director involvedbr br bizarre
