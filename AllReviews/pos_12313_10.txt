POS i believe john houstons the dead is a true classic not only was it houstons final film he is quoted as saying all i know about film making is in this film the story closely adapted from dubliners by james joyce is a great ensemble piece featuring sterling performances by angelica houston johns daughter and a cast of english and irish actors who bring the story to life this is a film that should be part of any serious collection not only because it is visually elegant but because the story is timeless and very appealing the film is not hurried nor is it charged with action rather the story unfolds from within the characters who bring light and meaning to the dialog the end of the film is stunning poetic and haunting i recommend the dead without reservation as one of the finest films ever made
