NEG scientists at a remote lab experiment on insert scaly creature here and create out of control monsters in the meantime a crack military teamthe scientists daughterbank robbers find their way to the remote place and are menaced by the giant critters one by one theyre eaten all during an exciting race to not be blown up by the forces who initially created the monsters the sad thing is that this sounds like about a dozen movies which have appeared on the scifi channel i have to wonder just what is going on sure i like bimbos and hollywoodhunk wannabes be eaten by cgi critters as much as the next person but wheres the plot or originality granted there are times when scifi channel shines battlestar galactica if a bit dark can be very good writers have continued to pump life into the various stargate offerings and the latest bbc import of doctor who is surprisingly goodbr br even in the various giant animal movies on scifi the animation seems to be getting better all the time compare the kommodo in this film to the rather clunky version in the first giant kommodo film on scifibr br but goodness how about a different plot maybe some different giant critter on a whim i started searching around the internet among the litter i found a few interesting stories which might appeal to sf fans and out of work russian cgi animators at once i offer httpwwwmacrophilecomarilinarchivemetamorphosisday to the network with a suggestion that they contact the author for the story rights the story contains violent images generally on a par with those of various scifi channel offeringsbr br the story has subplot ethical and moral comment on the nature of humanity and ends not on one of those horrible did they really kill all the monsters moments but rather leaves you guessing completely and in an entirely different mindsetbr br which is generally what sciencefiction is supposed to do no
