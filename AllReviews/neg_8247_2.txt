NEG i sat down through  hours of pure boredom i look here on imdb even though it is not high on the list it is in the top  i was a little surpised even though yes i am very impressed with robin and matts acting abilities they still didnt save the movie im not sure what i really didnt like about the movie maybe its because i dispise math maybe im not too much for dreary talking for  hours even though i loved american beauty but that was it i just want my  hours back it was a big waste of my time if im missing something in this movie please email me i am curious why this is on the top  and dont say because it was a good moviebr br
