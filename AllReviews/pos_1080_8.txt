POS i saw this film at the  toronto international film festival since i work in the wine business i had been quite eager to see this documentary and i wasnt disappointed reportedly drawn from over  hours of footage the good news is that nossiter will be releasing not only a theatrical cut but a tenpart ten hour series of the film on dvd by next christmas thinkfilm is distributing it the bad news is that its still a bit of an unwieldy beast when it was shown in cannes it was close to three hours long for toronto hes cut about half an hour but it still clocked in at  minutes now for me thats fine i love wine and i love hearing about the controversies raging in my business but not everyone wants that muchbr br nossiter flits around the globe from brazil to france to california to italy to argentina talking to wine makers and pr people and consultants and critics about the state of the wine world the theme that emerges is that globalization and the undue influence of wine critic robert parker are forcing a kind of sameness on wine small local producers are either being bought up by larger conglomerates american as well as local or are being pressured by market forces to change their wines to suit the palate of mr parker who dictates taste to most of the american and world marketsbr br its a complicated subject and i can understand why nossiter wants to let his subjects talk there is robert mondavi patriarch of the napa wine industry and his sons tim and michael whose efforts to buy land in languedoc faced opposition from local vignerons and government officials there is aim guibert founder and wine maker of daumas gassac iconoclastic opponent of mondavis plans and crusader for wines that express local terror there is robert parker himself expressing some discomfort with his influence while refusing to stop writing about the wines that he favours there is flying wine maker michel rolland consultant for dozens of wineries all over the world advising them how to make parker friendly wines there are many many more fascinating personalities in this documentarybr br if you are a wine lover you will want to seek out the tenpart series as well as the theatrical version of this film but even if youre not into wine the film is an interesting look at how the forces of globalization are changing many of the worlds oldest and most established traditions the effects on local cultures and economies cannot be ignoredbr br
