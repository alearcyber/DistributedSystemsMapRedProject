NEG when i first saw the trailer for the comebacks it looked absolutely horrible and i had no interest in seeing it but when it came out on dvd today i figured since there was nothing else that caught my interest i would rent it and give it a shot i watched it tonite and it really wasnt that bad i think it was immature and stupid at times but there were a few funny moments that made me laugh i dont really watch many sports movies so i wonder maybe if i saw more maybe this movie would make more sense to me but its all good i still didnt mind so much watching the comebacks i admit these stupid spoof movies are lame but whats the harm in a stupid joke every once in a while the comebacks isnt really that bad if you give it a fair chancebr br coach fields is failing in life family and career both but when he is offered a chance to bring his career back to life if he can bring a looser football team into the championship but the team is really really terrible like beyond terrible but with a little work and team effort they try to give it their all even though that might turn into something more sadbr br the comebacks over all isnt the worst film ive seen i think its good for a couple laughs and giggles i know that this was stupid but i couldnt help but laugh when the coach comes in the middle of a fight in the locker room and hes beating the nerds head against the locker just him and the nerd in general were so funny together if you have an open mind and dont take this movie too seriously i think youll have a fun time watching it if you watch it expecting it to be oscar worthy material this is not the movie for youbr br
