NEG paul muni and bette davis overact monstrously while lacklustre studio hack archie mayo seems distracted and oblivious in this racially provocative film that derives its bittersweet ending by condoning segregationist attitudes heavy handed and poorly constructed the film collapses under its own weight within the first fifteen minutes with an out of control courtroom scene that it never recovers from as mr muni begins to chew up scenery by the yard hollering and howling away in an almost incoherent fashionbr br johnny ramirez is a mexican american from the other side of the tracks who through determination and grit attains a law degree from a store front night school in his first big case involving an auto accident he displays only ineptitude and is quickly made to look the fool by his well heeled opponents and an impatient judge who recommends he be disbarred devastated by the setback an angry johnny takes on a job at a gambling joint where he is befriended by the owner charlie roark eugene palette who likes his style the owner cuts him in on the place but problems arise with mrs roark davis who also wants a piece of johnny she kills charlie implicates johnny and slowly goes mad before he is acquitted and free to be with a high society wasp who coldly explains to him that they are from different tribes savage and it will never work when she flees to escape his rage she is run over and killed by a car ramirez sells the casino and moves back to his poor neighborhood rationalizing that its best to stay with your ownbr br in addition to this appalling denouement bordertown has a series of bad performances to compliment the overall ugliness of the story unfair as his plight might be munis ramirez is so abrasive and arrogant it becomes hard to show sympathy for such a bull headed blunderer davis is no better as the less than loyal wife matching the same adolescent emotions of muni her lady macbeth mad scenes give no indication that she was about to become the best film actress of her era margaret lindsay as munis american dream is cold remote and flatbr br bad as bordertown is and it is very it remains an interesting indicator of the times and acceptable attitudes the rest is just a mishmash of bad acting and uninspired direction
