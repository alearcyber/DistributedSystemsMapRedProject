NEG these days ridley scott is one of the top directors and producers and can command huge sums to helm moviesespecially since he has films like alien gladiator and blade runner to his credit so from this partial list of his credits its obvious hes an amazing talent however if you watch this very early effort that he made while in film school youd probably have a hard time telling that he was destined for greatness thats because although it has some nice camerawork and style the film is hopelessly dull and uninvolving however considering that it wasnt meant for general release and it was only a training ground then i am disposed to looking at it charitablyhence the score of br br by the way this film is part of the cinema  european shorts dvd on this dvd are  shorts most arent great though because it contains the man without a head copy shop rabbit and wasp its an amazing dvd for lovers of short films and well worth buying
