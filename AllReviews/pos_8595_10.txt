POS this movie is the best movie i have seen in a long time it is also the best movie seen that uses a drama to tell history without going to speculation such as with jfknixon or hoffa it deftly depicts the clutches that belgium had on the congo it also teases out easily for us the european and american forces that were behind the power the inflict the congo today the film was sure to specifically implicate the us rightly so in the murder of lumumba this film could never be made in the us for us film rarely criticizes itself in acts of imperialism and murder save stones jfk it also lets us in on the problems that were present with the inner conflict of the congo between lumumba mobutu and katanga we can see how precarious countries sit in establishing new governments when their history is one of colonization and those who were the colonizers continue to pull the strings of power and force the film is excellently shot with eriq ebouaney an excellent lumumba the cast is great and they really draw you into the feeling of the climate in the congo during that timebr br again this is a must see for those who love drama with a correct historical background see my notes on quilombo
