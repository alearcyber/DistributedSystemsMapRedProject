POS this is a very good movie i give it a br br its very different in that its kind of a long stalking scene all the way through the fact that the main character is mute is used throughout the story in a very believable waybr br she sees a murder for a snuffmovie and decides to run but is chased this takes quite some time i wont reveal the rest of the movie for it would spoil the experience but rest assured its very believable well played very intense and has some nice surprises plus a great endingbr br dont miss this movie
