NEG from kreestos br br the dialog is terrible awful drivel acting poor many plot flaws i dont recommend this at allbr br from wikipediabr br artistic licenses the working manuscript of the score is attributed to two copyists  both of whom were male not female as depicted in the filmbr br the copyists neither contributed to nor altered the score in fact they were berated by beethoven for any deviation that occurred from the original scorebr br the movie is set in  during the composition of beethovens ninth symphony throughout the movie beethoven is shown to be hard of hearing but quite capable of understanding people who speak loudly in reality beethoven had lost much of his hearing seven years earlier  beethoven never experienced permanent deafness his condition fluctuated between total silence and terrible tinnitus the ninth symphony was composed at a time when beethovens hearing had deteriorated severely at this point in his life most of beethovens conversations were facilitated by the use of notebooks it can be argued however that he was also able to read peoples lips evidenced by his insistence that people face him when they spoke to himbr br in the film beethoven makes an allusion to the moonlight sonata this is an anachronism as the sonata no  quasi una fantasia was not named moonlight until several years after his death
