POS great book great movie great soundtrack frank sinatra shows in this movie that when he wanted to put the effort in he could act the ending is a bit schmaltzy but for the time its understandable the studio wanted a happy ending the graphic nature of the heroin addiction groundbreaking for the period is a plus add the terrific soundtrack and youve got one of the great american movies
