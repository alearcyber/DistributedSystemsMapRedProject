POS this sitcom was a big crowd puller in the year that was a time people could see deserted streets in most of the over crowded indian cities whenever there were sitcom on indian television screens all this was the result of the setting up of television relay stations across the entire indian nation this was one of the essential elements of the modernization of indian television network strategy adopted by the late indian prime minister indira gandhiit was also continued by her son rajiv gandhi this series provided clean entertainment which a large majority of indian television audience watched on their black and white television setsa funny thing about this series is that it was sponsored by an indigenous company dealing in ayurvedic products a couple of days ago i caught sight of some episodes of this series but the overall laughter equation was missing this goes on to prove that may be with the ever changing passage of time entertainment material lose their charm and hold over peoples minds
