POS this is a very moving movie about life itself the challenges a handicapped person must face in a land that expects perfection is brought to the forefront for all to see and hopefully understand it should teach the bigots of society that we are all humans and while some of us are gifted with a mind heart and sound body there are decent human beings that exist in the world that are not as lucky or maybe were the unlucky ones we dont always see the beauty in the world because were wrapped up in our blind ambitions and see it only in one light what can this world do for me maybe we all wish we were like radio a loving happy individualwho loves everyone
