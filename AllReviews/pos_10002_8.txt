POS i saw this film in a sneak preview and it is delightful the cinematography is unusually creative the acting is good and the story is fabulous if this movie does not do well it wont be because it doesnt deserve to before this film i didnt realize how charming shia lebouf could be he does a marvelous selfcontained job as the lead theres something incredibly sweet about him and it makes the movie even better the other actors do a good job as well and the film contains moments of really high suspense more than one might expect from a movie about golf sports movies are a dime a dozen but this one stands out br br this is one id recommend to anyone
