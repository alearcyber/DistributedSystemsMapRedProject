NEG first off just to say i didnt get the edition i thought i would  i chose the italian version over the r but what actually arrived was a uk release from   claiming to be a special edition  i never knew there was a uk dvd release  but the promised biogs were not actually on the disc  just a couple of duff trailers anyway  as to the film itself  just as i was recovering from night train murders my second genital mutilation thriller turns up in the same month  this time in an italian uk nubile schoolgirls are being offed and teacher fabio testi  unhappily married but nailing one of his students  becomes the main suspect joachim fuchsberger is the detective on the case sorry to say i was less than entranced it was watchable but more than equally miss ableand aside from the aforementioned gruesome nature of the crime the surprise killing of cristina galbo which was actually spoilt by the dvd cover telling me about it  grrrrrr and a surprise twist that cast the victims in a new light  i thought this was very routine itwont put me off the two sequels though with karin hannibal brooksbaal and camille i spit on your grave keaton
