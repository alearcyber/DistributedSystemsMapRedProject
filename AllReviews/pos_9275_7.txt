POS this documentary is as unique as its subject and while damatos staple was erotica the film manages to show some decent clips of the films you may remember from old time late night cinemax one problem joe did hardcore porno at times mixed with softcore erotica even mixed in his gore films the gore films are cult classics going for like  a pop for a dubbed copy on the net not peanuts for  year old films folks i want to see why those are cult classics also as sweet as joe seems he did seem more elegant than one might expect the dude liked to shock both caligula the untold story and emanuelle in america show us hardcore rape snuff and beastiality in both youd be suprised how far he goes in caligula ii with that one if you can track down an uncut print although these scenes may be disconforting in a documentary of a persons career hey he did it also i would have liked to see more interviews of people joe worked with maybe thats just me wanting to see what laura gemser looks like these days i still think shes a goddess and one of the sexiest women ever to grace the genre
