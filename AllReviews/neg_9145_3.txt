NEG weve all got to start somewhere it was in films like escape in the fog that somebody like budd boetticher could learn his trade before turning out good films in fact the film was dated before it even hit the movie going public on june  br br the war on europe was over for almost two months of course not even harry cohn could control the events of history so im wondering why even back then the public didnt question why a nazi spy ring was helping out the japanese another very bad historical inaccuracy was that the fbi had nothing to do with the pacific or asian theater the cloak and dagger stuff was the territory of the oss in that part of the worldbr br when youre an fbi man like william wright it sure good to have a psychic girl friend like nina foch hes about to go on a mission to the orient to deliver the names of key underground leaders to start a general uprising in china against the japanese occupation germans whove been bugging otto krugers house learn of this and the whole movie is spent with these guys whove already lost the war trying to help their allies who by the way they refer to as japs when foch is sideswiped by a speeding car and knocked unconscious she dreams about wrights danger and sees what is about to happen to him on the golden gate bridge she goes there and foils the plot br br all the stuff youd expect from a nice noir film is there the foggy atmosphere of san francisco the dimly lit sets budd boetticher tried his best as did the cast but they just werent convincing probably because they didnt believe this claptrap themselvesbr br its possible but not likely that nina fochs dream and its psychic consequences might have been more developed and the developments were left on the cutting room floor i think it was just a lousy screenplay br br and budd and harry cohn at columbia pictures had the fast moving events of history going against them here
