NEG young michael dudikoff like young lord greystoke was abandoned in the jungle on a pacific island as an infant but instead of being raised by the apes he fell into the hands of a japanese soldier who was still living there because he hadnt heard the war was over and like young luke skywalker it turns out he fell into the hands and learned the fighting skills of a ninjabr br good thing because they were separated and the young kid came down with a case of amnesia but those fighting skills didnt go away the orphaned kid now named joe armstrong enlists in the army and gets himself stationed in the phillipines meanwhile his obi wan kenobe played by john fujioka gets rescued himself and goes to work as a gardener on the estate of planter and terrorist go between don stewart using a cheesy accent that seems to vary between french and spanishbr br as these things happen everybody meets and dudikoff both solves the mystery of part of his past and saves the commanding officers daughter from the bad guys in this golanglobus production charles bronson was getting a bit long in the tooth now and golanglobus needed a new star for their action flicks michael dudikoff filled the bill quite nicely and made quite a few films for them including several american ninja sequelsbr br this film is all action and dudikoff dispatches bad guys at a record pace what he doesnt do steve james does doing his best rambo imitation and showing his considerable martial arts skillsbr br the film has enough holes in the plot to drive one of those army vehicles through you see in the story but thats what the ticket buying public doesnt care about dudikoff certainly looks magnificent stripped to his fighting clothes no wonder so many sequels were made
