NEG who really wants to see that disgusting violence disgusting sex for such a long time i do not want to but i always stayed true to my philosophy to watch any movie as bad as it may be this was the hardest right after next fridaybr br its basically just crap how can you possibly call it anything else the story of a roman emperor as an excuse for gore and ta yeah yeah hey its realistic they have been like this fine but why bother us with it i dont care if it has been like this and there are a lot of scenes where i truly doubt it the point is why should anyone wanna see it problem is there is only one reason you could like the film and that would be that you like violence theres nothing special about it just cruelty you can say cool as youd say in splatterslashermovie but horror movies with violence at least can give you chills and excitement maybe characters you care about but here everything is dark dull and boring every character is mad the story of an emperor who cant deal with his power what in the very first scene he runs naked through the woods with his sister i have no problem saying that we saw a madman for   hoursbr br but maybe you get turned on by seeing helen mirren being pregnant and dancing or  minutes of hardcore scenes that some people see as the message of the movie or castration yeah right that was fun real birth scenes how hilarious humans animals who cares lets just treat them as toysbr br i dont care what anyone says this is no movie this is just   hours of blood and sex degrading and disgusting go watch a porn movie if you want sex or watch a horror flick if you want violence at least those movies dont pretend to be some artistic masterpiece and they are shorterbr br
