POS when going to see rendition i was expecting an exciting film on a controversial topic with bigname actors i was not expecting a film that was so engrossing exciting poetic and sad that picked me up from the very beginning and didnt let me go even after i left the theater a word of advice to anyone who hasnt seen it yet dont let your politics come in the way of enjoying or not enjoying this film take it for what it is i saw this with my conservative jewish family im the black sheep the pseudoliberal college student and i thought they would write it off as liberal propaganda instead they said it was a great film with excellent performances they like to fancy themselves film criticsbr br its sad that a movie like this has to be marketed by its oscaraffiliated actors while leaving out the constantly underrated sarsgaard as well as new talent like the truly excellent metwally the entire cast gave good performances with some standing out much more than others my only problem with it was that there was a lot going on which didnt allow for much screen time for each of the characters in fact i felt like the subplot with fatima and khalid was just as prominent on screen as anwars part of the storybr br the characters all have the potential to fall into stereotypes but the actors do a good enough job to give them depth with the little screen time they have streep is truly terrific as a heartless senator and as much as i dont want to see the actress in such a terrible role its impossible not to believe her gyllenhaal who will probably be one of the oscar nods for this movie seems a bit unsure in his role at times hs trying to portray his inner conflict but usually just comes off like he either forgot his lines or he doesnt know how he should feel sarsgaard gave an excellent performance his unforgettable confrontation with streep is easily one of the best parts of the movie metwally again was terrific and i hope to see him in more mainstream films its a shame that gyllenhaal with probably get nominated before him yigal naor as shown on imdb has been is some films already but he is a newcomer in my eyes he along with mohammed khouas and zineb oukach all gave great performancesbr br the story of fatima and khalid was not given any credit in commercials but it brings a sad humanity to the story the narrative was interesting as i was trying to really connect the two story until it was plainly told to us at the end ive read some comments on here that say the love story was useless but i disagree i think it definitely shows another side to the controversial issue as well as humanity in general khalid was the real terrorist but he was doing it to avenge his brother and even though he is responsible for the attack you see a humane side to him through the story with fatima not that i think we should feel bad for actual terrorists but i think the we are all people theme was definitely relevantbr br whatever your feelings on terrorism politics etc leave it out of the theater the bottom line is this is an interesting story with a message we all need to hear
