POS i can barely even remember what decade i saw this film it was when i was a teenager i think im  now i started watching it as a late night movie sometime in the mid to early s and so much of it has stayed with me ever since seeing other comments i had no idea it was shown at theatres or that anyone else even new it existed i dont think ive even mentioned the movie to anyone elsebr br but half a lifetime later i still remember much of the movie that i watched late at night so long ago i think the innocence of the charactors their situation their mutual affection over a long period of time left a long term imprint for reasons i dont quite understand maybe it is because i was a teenager at the time i saw it and it touched me somehow i really dont know i also really wanted to know what was going to happen when the after the end of the film happened oh the agonybr br ive not seen it before or since but i would love to i keep a casual look out for it but i now doubt it will been shown and it seems to have faded into oblivion but id proberbly miss it in the tv guide even if it did show up psstttbr br reading the reviews here has renewed my interest if anyone knows of its availability in australia by all means email me and let me knowbr br oh and sean bury nice to see you make an appearance on the comments here ive had a look at your movie history and noticed your last appearance in a james bond film what are you up to these day oh and do you have a copy of the film cheers
