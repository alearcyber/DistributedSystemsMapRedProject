POS i would recommend this as the most successful attempt so far to make a movie on soviet afghan war and it is very honest and responsible picture starting from small details of uniforms and weapons up to human relations war routine and central asian landscapes its been shot in tajikistan just after the the troop withdrawal which happened in  not in  the italian star mr placido was just perfect in the role of major bandura other characters looked also very natural especially always drunk club managing officerthe scenario seems a bit jammed in the end but it might be an impact of the civil war in tajikistan which had started right during the shooting of the film all movie team had to escape sometimes even under fire the last scene is purely harakiri type of behavior and reminded me the final phrase from one famous samurai movie  weve won all battles but lost the war it could be also a metaphor of ussr collapse  the great country allowing to shoot itself to the back by the small offended child
