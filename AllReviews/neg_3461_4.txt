NEG this is defiantly a dvd rental movie im a big fan of the cast members but the storyline never really grabbed me dont expect oh brother where art thou in any way shape or form funniest part in my opinion is when the war hero explains what happens over in the argon seems like they were trying to copy some of clooneys funny facial expressions from oh brother where art thou but you could kind of tell they were trying for that john krasinski was the bright spot and was solid throughout renee zellweger plays the part of a zealous reporter willing to do whatever for the story overall its a movie worth watching at home
