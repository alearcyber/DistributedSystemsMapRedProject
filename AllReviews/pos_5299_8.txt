POS i have recently watched this film and have decided to comment on it br br the best way to watch this film is to not expect what you have seen in the past by miyazaki miyazaki is well known for his work on on spirited away and howls moving castle well for western viewers anyway both of them films were kind of similar to each other but at the same time completely different however ponyo is a whole different type of story and animation all together br br the story follows ponyo a fish that has the face a girl after ponyo runs away from her home at the bottom of the sea she find a whole new world she never knew was out there and new trouble as well when she almost caught by a fishing boat she was rescued by a five year old boy known as sousuke br br the story then follows the two of them and the pure friendship between a boy and a fish can ponyo really stay with sousuke forever  br br i feel the movie was inspired by the little mermaid and at the same time similar to tonari no totoro br br the movie is very short and you have very little time to learn about the characters in this movie but the characters a fish and a little boy so how much are you expecting to learn about them the film is set over about what seems to be  days i think this is why the movie is so short br br i really enjoyed watching this movie and i hope you all enjoy this movie as well
