NEG jack frost  was a horrible terrible sadly pathetic excuse for a sequal to a great movie the original was a low budget comedy horror film about a murdered who was turned into a snowman after an accident with some toxic waste and the snowman went around murdering people and avoiding blow dryers like the plague this however was a far cry from the quality of the original it seems like this even had a lowerbudget because for some reason after an hour into this film i still hadnt seen the snowman some revenge hes getting if hes always in the form of ice cubes with a cheesy voiceover and a little shake of the cooler he rests in to give animation to the character disappointing to no belief even for a fan of bad cinema
