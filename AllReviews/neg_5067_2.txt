NEG this music is totally out of touch with the film showing up now and then as wagnerian bombast and lone ranger hurryup otherwise nonexistent the acting outside of the two principals is nonexistent it would have been an excellent student film the russian soldiers are just models trying to act the constant interruptions with wowexplosivecamera angles and monocolor clips of pieces of people were quite irritating but thats just a personal feeling the story line isnt worse than others actually not worse than most completely ignoring logic and reason and reality at least nobody walked in front of a machine gun for three minutes without being hit the three toplevel bad guys were campy
