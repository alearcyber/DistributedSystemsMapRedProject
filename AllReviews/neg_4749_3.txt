NEG i was only fourteen when i first saw the alien movies and i immediately came to like it original terrifying and classic sigourney weaver was the perfect choice for the female hero character and she would have deserved a statuette for her act in  something everlasting was born than the immortal series continued with a nothing less legendary movie than the first alien was a different point of view but i think this part was the most stressful and unique of all this was my favourite unfortunately the last one was a failure in many ways it was strained illogical with full of meaningless massacres i didnt like it at all but i never thought that a worse part would ever be made in the future well as it turned out in  i was wrong alien vs predator was a bad break and it should have been directed by a more talented director or should have never been made at all but when i saw alien vs predator requiem i was totally shocked moreover devastated when i sat down and decided to watch it with full of doubt even than i had never thought that such a bad movie could be made without a screenplay without a director and without actors i dont understand how can a film be made because this film misses these three terms what you get is a nice massacre show without a story but with a lot of annoying and boring dialogues waste of money and waste of time this movie is rather impudence than honor to the fans of the both sides alienpredator shame
