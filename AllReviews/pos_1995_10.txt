POS everybody seems to compare this to the matrix and the th floor and when i first saw it i would have agreed  i was expecting the matrix and was a little disappointed but upon repeated viewings my respect for this movie has grown immenselybr br the thing to keep in mind is that the matrix is a great action movie with some philosophical mumbojumbo thrown in the th floor is a passable action movie with some slightly more interesting philosophical mumbojumbo thrown in existenz is not an action movie at all and is not as many seem to believe about reality or any such deep concept its about the human tendency to intentionally replace reality with an artificial both in its origin and in its behavior world of makebelievebr br the most chilling moment in the movie is when allegra geller repeats her scripted line its at that point you realize that the people in the game have voluntarily surrendered their free will in order to participate in a story this is made even more frightening at the end when darcy nader or rather his player comments on the possibility of spending ones life in the game i sympathize completely with the realist philosophy that providing interesting worlds in which people simply locate the correct predefined path to the end goal is ultimately a recipe for a soulless existence living in the game is not living at all but is a tempting way to spend ones time on earth as allegra comments about the real world theres nothing going on here might as well jack into someone elses imagination and pretend to be doing something interesting although i have to ask whether cronenberg considers this a selfindictment considering that he himself offers up worlds to be experienced in  minute snippetsbr br upon leaving the theater after first watching this movie i thought it was one of those movies that was watchable only to see how it ended but having seen it a couple more times thank you scifi channel ive realized how much deeper it goes seriously if youve only seen it once it deserves another viewing
