NEG as long as you go into this movie with the understanding that its not going to contain any historical fact whatsoever its not badbr br its on par with sam raimis hercules the legendary journeys as far as plot acting humour and production values are concerned youll see the similarities at several points most of the fight scenes are not as good however and the film suffers from thatbr br jack palance commands the screen as well as ever and at no time do you have the impression hes giving anything less than his level best same for oliver reed the problem is that their strong performances make squarejawed don diamonts lessthanstellar acting skills seem even more awkward perennial bit player cas anvar was very good as well playing a character much like salmonius in the aforementioned herculesbr br if you enjoyed the low budget swordsandsorcery movies of the early s youre probably going to enjoy this show as well its actually a shame they attached the marco polo name to it it really has nothing to do with marcos life contrary to the expectations of most of the people who will want to watch this movie
