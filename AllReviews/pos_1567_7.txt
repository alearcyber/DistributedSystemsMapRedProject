POS theres nothing much to the story a young woman steals some money from the dreary vermont supermarket where she works decides to run away to florida where he has dreams of attending school with her friend julie and encounters an odd couple on the highway if you remember the elderly couple from rosemarys baby you have some idea of what these two are like bill has a comical face and is retired from the army sandra is an ex stripper now become a truckstop whore although we dont find this out at once theyre affectionate helpful and full of common sensebr br they more or less adopt the girl alice and promise to give her a ride in their elaborate rv although they are not driving directly to floridabr br this is where the film could have gone onehundredpercent wrong all the film makers had to do was turn the elderly couple into the personification of evil they would take the virginal alice handcuffed to the bed or whatever and sell her body to any greaseball driver who has a lot of money and likes rough sex alice would have had a heck of a time escaping with lots of aborted attempts before the final shootout but no the couple really is pretty nice and alice is far from virginal alice overhears sandra with a customer asks about the business and tries to turn a trick on her own bill prevents anything from happening and insists she do the job right if shes going to do it at all they dont talk her into it they guide herbr br alice makes several hundred dollars which is several hundred dollars more than she had when she met the couple bill and sandra keep her money in the safe where customers arent going to find it alice misunderstands she doesnt find whoring very pleasant work and she thinks shell never be paid off because every time she asks to be dropped off sandra responds with what not here honey not in the middle of nowhere however after she is talked into handing her gun over to sandra the couple give her the money she wants and rather lovingly release her to continue her trip to floridabr br you know what i found the most tragic moment in the film it had nothing to do with prostitution or thievery alice has been expecting to room with her friend julie after she arrives in miami julie is after all a legitimate student but when alice calls her friend from someplace in alabama to assure her shes on her way but will be late julie hesitates and says well  my mother doesnt think you should room with us and to tell you the truth my roommate isnt cool on it either i invited you down sure but i thought it was just like a visit for a week or something go back to milford alice there is a long silence before alice hangs upbr br only one shot is fired a few white frames of film and no one is hit tears appear only once nobody slugs anybody else no car explodes in a fireball no cop chases them down the interstatebr br the direction is occasionally clumsy too much crosscutting between sandra trying to disarm alice and alices hand holding the wobbling pistol there is hardly any musical score there is brief male and female nudity and its awkward as its probably supposed to be alice isnt unattractive but she is not babalicious either she sports asiatic eyes a kind of robust version of molly parker the cinematography looks cheap and the colors are washed out the direction is a straightforward narrative with a few illuminating flashbacks nothing is wasted and it was all evidently shot around danbury connecticut the city sticks in my mind because i drove through it after one of its floods and remember the cars caked with a film of mud all the way up to the door handlesbr br i dont know exactly what alice found i dread even thinking that the answer to the riddle is that she found herself the acting isnt bad at all judith ivey is better than that its definitely worth seeing a quiet orderly film that treats the audience like adults
