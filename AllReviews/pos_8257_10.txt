POS i have seen this movie about  times and every time i am impressed with the second camera assistants work seems trivial but there is something very professional knowledgeable and talented there the movie as a whole suffers from other problems as stated by other comments the significance so the issues being approached are as relevant today as it was  years ago the acting is a bit strained but the work of the second camera assistant is stellar this person needs to get back into the business  perhaps directing what is this person waiting for i will be watching and waiting and cheering from the sidelines bob
