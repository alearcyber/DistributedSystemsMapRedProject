NEG i really liked the idea of traveling between dimensions and i even liked the wadequinn tension in early episodes some of the worlds they created gave the main characters extremely interesting backdrops for their stories however as the show went on there were more silly disputes among the friends and less of a true bond there was less wonder and excitement when they were involved in other worlds and more condescension and every world had one of the characters falling in love the writing just got boring and everything was way too over the top too bad it wouldve been nice to have a closely knit band of friends a la star wars traveling to different dimensions on tv for several years rather than a tired band of knit pickers
