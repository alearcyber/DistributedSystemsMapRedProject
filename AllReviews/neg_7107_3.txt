NEG the film is very fastmoving bizarre and colorful its like mad max on speed whit tons of colorers and makeup also very cartoonish as that said cartoon sequence pops up here and there the plot is also very saucy but ill believe its meant too be the thing that really drives me crazy in this movie is the characters they are painfully irritating especially rebecca played by lori petty shes really annoying ill believe she is the most annoying creature ive ever seen the editing is also annoying very mtv stylized another thing thats missing from tank girl is an exciting adventure the humor isnt much funny either it has some nice visuals thoughbr br however a lot of people love this film most of them are women and thats not weird at all because this movie is all about girl power tank girl this is a real chick flick and the best example of an hatelove film
