POS the above summary really isnt meant as a slam against this film as the series followed a very similar format as usual simon templar the saint meets a lady in distress and comes to her aid he also comes to the aid of a police detective who was framed of accepting a bribe along the way he meets some interesting supporting characters this time paul guilfoyle as pearly gates and during his unraveling of this not especially compelling mystery none of them really are templar is extremely erudite and just plain cool george sanders is once again the consummate sophisticated british dogooder and he succeeds once again in making an excellent bdetective series film nothing particularly special but a familiar and breezy product sure to please fans of the genre
