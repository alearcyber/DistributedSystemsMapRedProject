POS the most intense and powerful film i have seen in years there have been other films before that delved into the vietnam vet but nothing compared to this emotionally heartwrenching film as a typical american suburban family circa  comes apart at the seams revealing the scars that vietnam has left on our all of our collective souls the cast is a fantastic with all four actorswith kathy bates a standout giving riveting performances what is wonderful about this film is that you take no sides but understand all four characters and empathize with them even though all four have divergent viewpoints and needs there are scenes in here that are so powerful as family secrets and feelings are revealedsuch as the confrontation between son and mother that will have you emotionally drained and in tears of anguish i actually cried in this film something i rarely do the shocking end is a stunner a much overlooked film that should be seen i rate this  film a  a superlative piece highly recommended especially in this day and age with again our country embroiled in a hideous war our headlines shouting of atrocities and again our young men and women returning with deep psychological scars with their deep pain of deeds done in the line of honor a must see film
