NEG i consider myself to have a decent sense of humor but this movie left me stunned in my chairbr br its so bad that it could just not have been any worse not once did i laugh at the sadly attempted jokes in this movie i have watched and enjoyed several parodies of big movies but unfortunately this one will allways be the one i remember best  in my nightmaresbr br the only reason anyone should want to watch this is if they want to enter a coma for a brief period of timebr br this is the worst movie ever
