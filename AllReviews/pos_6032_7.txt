POS being a self confessed slasher addict means that its very rare that i get the chance to review many bigger budgeted movies with creditable casts aside from james mangolds successful box office draw identity there have not been any big name entries since the scream trilogy once again put wes cravens name back on the hollywood map thats why mark malones the last stop  a mystery thriller with blatant slasher overtones instantly intrigued me with a decent lineup including adam beach and jurgen prochnow and an intriguing soundtrack that even finds space for lynn andersons rose garden i must admit that the initial signs were very positive for this claustrophobic feature to the best of my knowledge there have only ever been three other snowbound slashers unless of course you consider demon possessed to fit in the category the first slice and dice on the ice was the bonedry satans blade then came the lisa loring cheesefeast that was blizzard of blood and the enjoyable shredder followed some fourteen years laterbr br during an extreme blizzard state trooper jason adam beach battles through the snow to reach a remote lodge in the colorado mountains his task is to inform the guests that the road is closed and they must stay for at least one more night until a path can be cleared through the hazardous conditions this news doesnt go down to well with the suspicious bunch which includes two troublemaking brothers callum keith rennie and peter flemming a truck driver that really doesnt want to hang around william s taylor a randy couple of lovers winston rekert and amy adamson and jasons exgirlfriend nancy rose mcgowan the motel owners jurgen prochnow and p lynn johnson arent overjoyed by the news either but they offer rooms to the stranded guests and attempt to calm the tense situation things take a turn for the worse when jason finds a mutilated body and a bag full of stolen cash lying in the snow behind the cafe just like a chapter out of an agatha christie mystery the lodgers begin dieing at the hands of a masked assailant that seems intent to reclaim the money with so many dodgy characters to choose from and no way of leaving the crime scene jason has to attempt to stop the maniac before he kills again br br a good mystery needs at least a handful of shady suspects who each have a credible motive a remote location that no one can escape from and a smart protagonist to help unravel the clues fortunately the last stop provides each of those essential ingredients in a thriller that has its equal moments of brilliance and downright stupidity the film kicks off superbly as the dubious personalities clash in a claustrophobic environment that manages to keep the tension running high throughout the runtime malone keeps the interest levels raised as each character unveils their own reasons to attract some of the suspicion and to be fair the essential twist isnt one that youll guess easily in fact i found myself watching the movie through once again to see if i could pick up on any hints that i missed first time around unfortunately when the maniac is revealed to be an over the top psycho that wisecracks like a comic book bad guy the last stop forfeits a huge amount of credibility thankfully all is not lost when an unexpected and brilliantly orchestrated plot twist salvages the films finalebr br similarities can be drawn with the excellent identity as the two plots are almost interchangeable james mangolds effort has to be the better of the two mainly because of the star billing of john cusack and the everreliable ray liotta with that said though adam beach does a good enough job in the lead while jurgen prochnow amy adamson and the brilliant callum keith rennie add some credible support rose mcgowan acts as conceitedly in this role as she probably does from day to day in reality and winston rekert started fantastically before going completely overboard with the films climax if youre a diehard slasher fan thats watching this for some bloody killings then youre going to be disappointed the balaclavawearing psychopath only pops up once and the rest of the murders are committed offscreen but as i said earlier malones directorial talent means that the suspense is never too far off the boil and you can forgive the few flaws because the positives just about triumphbr br the last stop is well worth a look for slasher addicts and movie fans alike yes there are a handful of negatives but overall this is a solid example of emerging hollywood talents if you liked identity then certainly give this a try
