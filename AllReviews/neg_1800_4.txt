NEG heart of darkness movie review joseph conrads heart of darkness is pretty dark deep and very profound i would have to say reading the novel is way better than the movie the character mr kurtz played by john malcovik was totally the wrong actor to do the part he fit the character in of mice and men the movie left out man key parts that i consider important to get the true message of the storybr br the movie is poorly edited it shows a lot of nonimportant and annoying flashes in the novel it has a very suspenseful atmosphere but in the movie it lacks that kind of feeling in the book there is so much that was left to the imagination of the reader for example when marlow spent timeless hours and days waiting for rivets and that entire scene was left out of the movie in the novel marlow waited very long time for the rivets to come for him to fix his boat this was a big source of futility in the novel the movie added more parts that were useless and kind of didnt make sense for example when kurtz was talking to marlow at the end of the book and kurtz snapped the monkeys neck and killed him that kind of just ruined everything didnt make any sense to me what so ever so my suggestion to you is dont view the movie just read the book you will understand more and have a better interpretation of the storybr br chris c
