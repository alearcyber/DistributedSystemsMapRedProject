NEG macbeth ive always thought is the most accessible of shakespeares great period plays compact focused with heaps of violence it should have been the play most open to screen adaptations im not aware of a really good rendering of the story however  the best effort being orson welless vigorous shoestring version to the list of macbotches we must add the connerybaxendale effortbr br it seems it was not a film adaptation at all but a tv version that was given a theatrical release post luhrmans romeo  juliet and branaghs hamlet that might explain some of its flaws but doesnt excuse them br br it starts well with a feisty battle sequence with pleasingly grisly witches looking on poor old gray malkin and paddock are cut from the opening scene but they arent alone for long in quick order they are joined by the bloodied sargent and his account of the battle the treachery of the thane of cawdor the luckless master o the tiger even macbeths meeting with duncan when he is invested as thane of cawdor all of these had virtues that plead like angels trumpet tongued against the dark damnation of their sending off but sent off they are these arent the only cuts either this is macbeth in a hurrybr br from the opening battle we are pitched directly into macbeths encounter with the witches which is well done brian blessed curiously directed the witchy sequences and he has great fun with the special effects as macbeth and banquo are told of their fates jason connery as macbeth is awkward obviously unsure what to make of the verse graham mactavish as banquo on the other hand is capable making his lines natural and easy within a few minutes of connerys mumbling the viewer is struck the urge to see the roles reversed and mactavish in the title role no wonder macbeth felt he needed to kill himbr br these first few minutes marks the high point of the film from there we move to helen baxendale receiving word of her husband shes as lost as connery and denied the beard that he gets to hide behind her unsex me here invocation of evil is embarrassing not unsettling there are some reasonably clever touches  macbeths we will speak further is not a sign of his hesitancy in the face of his wifes wicked ambition but his attempt to silence her prattling as he throws her onto the bedbr br the acting of the leads is the biggest let down connerys method consists of staring glazedly about the screen while he mumbles his monologues via voiceover baxendale looks pinched and neurotic an attempt to do something interesting with is this a dagger  the fantastical dagger is a shadow cast by a cross on an altar  falls flat due to connerys poor delivery and sloppy direction which mars the production throughout we accompany lady macbeth back into the murder chamber where she gets to stab the reviving duncan but the effect is comic not dramaticbr br big scenes are botched  the appearance of banquo at the feast is made incomprehensible through attempts to mix subjective rendering of macbeths delusion with what those around him see or dont see the second meeting with the witches is even less coherent and the prophetic visions are confusing timing seems to be an issue here  banquos banquet is the centrepoint of the play but the film moves rapidly towards conclusion after it giving it an unbalanced feel and no scope for the intricacies of the riddles macbeth is caught in to be appreciated or for his descent into madness to be convincing another crucial cut is the scene where malcolm tests macduff and macduff learns of the murder of his family this robs his revenge of most of its emotional force  and the character of a lot of the screen time hes a virtual stranger when he turns up to kill macbethbr br a point for trying mactavishs banquo earns another the first few minutes garners another but thats all from then on its sound and fury blah blah blah
