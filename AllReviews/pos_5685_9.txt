POS i live up here in croc territory and remember well the true events that inspired this movie our guts fall out each time we hear of a croc attack black water is quite simply the best croc movie i have ever seen while i loved rogue last year for all its effects and splashy scenes it was the local scenes that captured our audience we laughed in rogue more than anything black water however really resonated with the eeriness and fear that you can experience when you are alone in the mangroves you guys call them swamps or bayous  but theyre mangroves every tourist should see this film before heading to the northern territory the ending was a bit of a letdown after the rest of the film but ill be adding this one to my dvd collection when it becomes available
