POS i had never paid much attention to this flick until i learned that paddy chayefsky  author of the brilliant network  was the scriptwriter his work there had instructed me as to his genius so when hospital appeared on tmc i was anxious to see it i was not disappointed looking at both this film and network it would seem that his big theme is the absurdity inanity and sheer viciousness of large human enterprises eg hospitals networks against the sanctity of individual experience and the human spirit and all of it delivered with a knifeedge sense of utterly black humor hospital is as black of a comedy as network is and the excellent cast led by the incomparable scott does his work full justice this is a keeper definitely not to miss
