NEG imagine if you will an alternative universe where someone has made seven where instead of a talented cast and crew theyve cast a politically conscious environmentalist and a stand up comedian as the leads  if your imagination cant stretch that far just watch the glimmer man as its the next worse thing br br  mild spoilers br br jack cole is a cop with a hidden past and its very ironic that hes played by steven seagal since hes also someone witrh a hidden past  but dont tell anyone because its top secret  perhaps the biggest secret is how someone like seagal became a movie star in the first place since the glimmer man continues in the vein of all of seagals other movies in that its utter  utter crap  look at the way hes introduced as his partner walks into his office  yoi love beads man  in youre in the wrong office  steven replies with something that is side splittingly witty  or he would if anyone was able to understand a bloody word he said because for much of the movie he just mumbles away  in fact the only time i could make out his dialogue was the scene at the school where he bursts in on the gunman holding the class hostage br br  dont make me kill you  br br is this what a cop would say to a suicidal gunman  im just thinking that in another movie where steven isnt the hero  ie a good movie  the cop would say something along the lines of  dont kill me  ive got a wife and a couple of kids waiting at home   so anyway suicidal gunman goes to blow his head off but steven saves his life by hurtling them both through two sets of windows  it goes without saying that you shouldnt try this at homebr br as the story progresses steven  ive given up on calling him jack though credit to the screen writer for giving steven a sensible name  becomes involved in a case a plagiarism where someone has been stealing bits out of other superior movies featuring serial killers  as steven finds more victims you can see him thinking  what was that movie that starred morgan freeman as a cop   as he inspects the bodies  oh and the action keeps switching back to the heros domestic life just so we know that this guys good as a family man  this guys very good as a family man such a pity hes so bad as a movie star
