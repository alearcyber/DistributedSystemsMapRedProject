POS i am a massive hitchcock fan ever since seeing rear window on television saboteur is not hitchcocks best for me though it is very good but not a masterpiece it does have its faults some parts are rather slow moving and as a consequence of it being written off in a hurry the script felt rather incomplete but hitchcocks direction is superb and the performances werent that bad while robert cummings and priscilla lane both do a good enough job otto kruger and norman lloyd come very close to stealing the show the story is good about a wronged man on the run very similar themes used in  steps and north by northwest and cleverly provides some much needed escapism the music score was absolutely outstanding the music in the opening title sequence was phenomenal almost like a distorted march and i liked the digs at tchaikovskys st piano concerto and beethovens th symphony the cinematography is also crisp and smooth the scenery and landscapes almost dazzling and there are also a number of very effective scenes namely the statue of liberty climax but the circus troupe encounter and the radio music city hall shootout is also on the money overall not hitchcocks best but definitely worth the look  bethany cox
