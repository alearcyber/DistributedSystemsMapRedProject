NEG br br i rented this movie on  june  and watched it for about  minutes i concluded that watching a blank screen would be delightful by comparison there was not a single person in the cast for whom i would have shed a tear if hell itself had opened up and swallowed the whole bunch of thembr br so i emailed all of my friends and relatives warning them and i am taking the time to urge everyone who may see this note to avoid this movie like the plague i have seen some really bad movies in my time but never one as bad as this
