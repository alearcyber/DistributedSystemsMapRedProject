NEG rented this from my local blockbuster under the title speck  that may be the way to look for it if you still feel the need to see it after this reviewbr br its a movie about the serial killer richard speck who killed several nurses in chicago in the sixties watching the movie one gets the feeling that it follows the crimes to the letter unfortunately that doesnt make for a good moviebr br another problem i had was the nearconstant music letting us know that this was a scary movie and some godawful narration letting us know whats motivating speck the acting was average for this type of film to give credit where credit is due the movie is very beautifully photographed for my taste your mileage may varybr br over all if youre interested in the subject matter it may be worth your time
