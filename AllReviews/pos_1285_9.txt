POS just watched this on dvd three times  once the normal way once with the scenes in consecutive order in this doozy of a film noir the beginning middle and end of the story intertwine and once with the directors commentary running quite amazing a barebones tale told with more flair energy and substance than most bigbudget overblown features being released today br br i think this is an even more accomplished film than the subsequent memento which turned me on to nolan in the first place cant wait to see what he does with a bigger budget and bigger boxoffice stars in his next film insomnia
