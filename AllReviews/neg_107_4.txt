NEG low budget horror movie if you dont raise your expectations too high youll probably enjoy this little flick beginning and end are pretty good middle drags at times and seems to go nowhere for long periods as we watch the goings on of the insane that add atmosphere but do not advance the plot quite a bit of gore i enjoyed bill mcghees performance which he made quite believable for such a low budget picture he managed to carry the movie at times when nothing much seemed to be happening nurse charlotte beale played by jesse lee played her character well so be prepared to want to slap her toward the end she makes some really stupid mistakes but then thats what makes these low budget movies so good i would have been out of that place and five states away long before she even considered that it might be a good idea to leave if you enjoy this movie try committed from  which is basically a rip off of this movie
