POS i have seen this movie about  times already and it doesnt look like i am ever going to get bored of it i always watch it with my best friend and it has become sort of a tradition for us now to watch it almost every month every single time we see this movie we both get really emotional and we laugh and cry in front of the tv together and sing all the songs in a loud voice and in the end we always danceby now we practically know even the whole dialog by heart and watching the film feels like seeing our own old friends on tvbr br this film is perfect even though i have to admit that the story itself is a bit cheesy but the characters the dance the music and even the place where it all takes place make you forget all about it and you start believing that things like that really do happen and that the song all you need is love actually has some kind of a meaningbr br i am really a normal person and not too serious about this comment of mine but i just cant wait until the next time well be able to see dirty dancing
