NEG i saw this film as a sneak preview before the venice opening at the telluride film festival your reaction to it will largely depend on your attitude about respecting the text of shakespeare on the plus side pacino gives a very good performance indeed as shylock lynn collins is a fine portia and the film has a sumptuous look br br the negatives are predictable the merchant of venice is arguably the most difficult of all of shakespeares plays to stage today largely because we look at it through the distorting lens of th century history the romantic plot with bassanio and portia presents no problem the character of shylock does because we lack the original frame of reference of the elizabethan audience shylock is simultaneously a human character with human qualities and motivations and an abstraction of the pitiless quality of the old law when he says hath not a jew eyes he is a character when he proclaims i will have my bond he is an abstraction the long passage on music and cosmic harmony in the final scene here moved and cut to ribbons is the key to the play in that it reestablishes universal harmony after the disruptive and evil the shylock of the trial scene forces are ejected it is possible to make psychological sense of the character of shylock by showing his gradually going mad and turning into a monomaniac by the time the trial scene rolls aroundthe key is that at a point he must cease being sympatheticbr br pacinos performance almost does it but not quite the film cant quite make up its mindon the one hand there is the right movement in the character of shylock and on the other there is a great deal of extraneous footage of jews being abused and venetian whores with rouged nipples no doubt to show the decadence of antonio et al shakespeare was not writing an ibsenlike social drama he was writing a comedy following the classic pattern of disruption of social order and the restoration of social order symbolized by marriage with a theme of love versus law at the center of the shylock plotbr br in this sense the film is a travestyradfords surgery on the play and direction almost force us away from what the play really means taking the beginning of the final scene cutting most of it and moving it before the trial scene is the most extreme example there are some other significant difficulties jeremy irons a fine actor plays antonio as if he were overdosed on sedatives joseph fiennes is pretty but shallow as bassanio most of the actors with the exceptions of collins pacino and the actor playing the duke in the trial scene mumble their dialoguebr br final verdict a pretty film with a few decent performances its not shakespeare its poor interpretation not really worth your time or moneyalthough lynn collins as portia almost redeems it
