NEG on the scale of  to  i gave this a  i thought the film was not very good with too much violence and not one character to likebr br on an erotic scale i give this a  many of the sex scenes were tinged with an underlying ugliness i always enjoy nudity and nancy travis and faye grant come through but the sex scenes were more humiliating than erotic
