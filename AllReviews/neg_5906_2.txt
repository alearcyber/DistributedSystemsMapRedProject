NEG it was praised to be a fast paced screwball comedy and the best german movie of the year so i gave it a try even though ive already seen some films by dani levy  or at least parts of thembr br i got what i had expected no comedy at all unless you think that heart attacks are funny its a fine example of sloppy screen writing with an implausible plot and characters loaded with clichs that might be true but surely are not funny eitherbr br the most annoying character is that of zuckers wife played by hannelore elsner she has to behave incredibly strange to keep the plot moving for example she doesnt know a single thing about judaism but by reasons most likely unknown to even herself she gets the idea to play the charade that she and her family are jewish laws obeying jews for her husbands family who really are and of the very orthodox and selfrighteous variety to make it a bit more complicated she invites the four of them to stay at her city flat because they arrive from frankfurt in berlin without having booked their hotels in advance something no  years old business man actually no grownup german would ever do this gives the viewer a lot to swallow but still fails to produce any jokesbr br zucker and his brother samuel havent seen each other for forty years but it turns out that his daughter  now a lesbian  and samuels son  now a militant orthodox  were once lovers and hes her daughters father samuels daughter  a nympho  goes after zuckers gay son is this supposed to be a somehow humorous parody of jewish incestuous tendencies probably its just a thoughtless way to add some love action turbulence every screwball comedy needs and of course is also fails to produce any jokesbr br the praise for this movie is purely political therefore only people who enjoy watching movies that are supposed to be politically important will enjoy this one  even though alles auf zucker quite clearly has no importance of any kindbr br for all the rest dont watch it without a fast forwardoption i really missed it
