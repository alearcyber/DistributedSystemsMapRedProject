POS yes its a fast times wannabe but its still decent entertainmentbr br some of the comedy parts are really funny the scene when the three guys visit the spanish lady is hilarious with a little flamenco music in the background the reaction when her sailor husband comes home is a riot the guys exploits in dealing with crabs are funny as well when they try to drown them and when they visit the pharmacist br br the abortion scene is a fast times ripoff too but it does do a good job of capturing the terror of the situation you really feel for what karen is going through and for gary in his mad scramble for cash to pay for the abortion and accommodating her recoverybr br the ending is painful to watch but refreshingly realistic firsttime viewers will not be prepared for it and it will be a shockbr br there is a decent eyecandy for guys with young girls and the milf spanish lady but heterosexual guys will probably want to skip the penismeasuring competition br br underrated soundtrack too check out early early u the cars in their prime and an appropriate tearjerker song by james ingram for the surprise endingbr br some people will hate it and it is somewhat dated but those who like teen flicks or grew up in the early s should like it
