POS i had never seen the original death wish in the book either death wish i film however death wish  was the very interested film the wellknown vigilante paul kersey tried to visit his friend charlie but he only visited him for a couple of minutes before he died because of charlie didnt pay the protection to the huge and infamous underground gang leaded by manny franker after some altercation during his time in jail kersey learned that franker who he fought with in jail had his own agenda to make the new york city in the hellfire and also his influence by sending his henchmen to set the crime every time everywhere and everyday due to the chance given by insp richard shriker who know his profile well and like him very much kersey decided to set the war with franker and his gangbr br i accepted that death wish iii was one of the most straightedge and extreme violence action film which i had seen from the past this movie used the very straightedge way to tell the story no ponderous storytelling and less unnecessary scenes which was the one merit of the movie on the next issue violence was used pervasively in the film i believed that many of viewers could like the action scene of death wish iii because it showed the crude extreme and blast of action for every minutes of the movie especially the climax scene of the movie and the death of manny franker which i thought that it was the maximum action scenebr br for about the cast i think everyone was good and get through their role charles bronson made everybody believe that he still be great as paul kersey he didnt look like the big old cat but the great vigilante gavan oherlihy also did his job very good his main villain role in the movie made him look nasty and look like the big bad guy however the role of kathryn davis in this movie was pathetic she didnt look like the main character i thought that she was appeared only two or three scene before she was killed by franker and his follower to make a heat on paul kersey she could have more role to appearbr br for my comment the straightedge style and extreme violence made this movie great for extreme action film fans fastpaced with back and forth style made this movie very interested to watch nevertheless this movie had some silly scene and some plot hole first the scene when inspshriker faced paul kersey for the first time it was very corny because you attacked your favor guy before you want him to help it similar to how you punch some guy before you try to borrow him some money haha thats like a joke although i liked the plot twist when inspshriker was shown later that he helped kersey because at first shriker looked like the villain very much due to his act to kersey but when the movie went to the climax everything was cleared that he had no hidden agenda with kerseybr br in another case the ending scene of the movie set back me it stumble on everyones feeling because it ended too easy frankers gang members looked unbelievable after they found that franker was dead before his girlfriend and other followers decided to escape finally inspshriker allowed paul kersey to fly out from his town before the police caught him i thought that this style of ending scene could be found in many cannon films movie but i dislike itbr br for the summary i am ok with death wish  due to my explanation i typed first the cast and the action was very good and so extreme even it had some scene i dont like straightedge and extreme of violence could be the best short description of this movie
