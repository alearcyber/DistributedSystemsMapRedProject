NEG lame bhorror that takes itself too damn seriously considering its subject matter concerns an aging old dear who has been turned into a creature of the night by a lodger who has come to rent a room from her when said lodger is killed off mom has to go out to feed on her own and that causes some family strain and also garners some attention from the authoritiesbr br my main complaint is that this film should have brought the funny it failed to do so although it did have some mild gore and schlocky creature makeup effects to keep the bmovie crowd happy ive seen worse but i wouldnt give this one a rec
