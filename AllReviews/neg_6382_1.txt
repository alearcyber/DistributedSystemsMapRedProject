NEG i got this movie from the library and saw it had a lot of actors i like in itjohn cleese ian holm ralph richardson etc so i got it and watched it i expected cleese to have a large role since he had first billing i was surprised to find out that he had about five minutes of screen time along with everyone else i liked this movie is amazingly pointless the characters are nobodies the plot is nonexistent and the ending is one of the worst endings i have ever seen there were a few funny parts but thats about it stay away from this movie if you want to prevent going what and huh a lot and if you dont want to waste your time ignore the people who say this is a very funny movieit isnt just stay away from it at all costsplease
