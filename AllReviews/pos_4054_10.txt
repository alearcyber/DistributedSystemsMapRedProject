POS i saw this movie on pbs the first time then i bought the video and watched it countless times every time i watch it i can get something else out of it its a real testament to wanting to hold onto a life that was good but now the world is changing but you dont have to be older to hold onto the past even the young characters like charlotte dont want things to change the overall tone and mood is excellent the cast is outstanding with allstars like kathy bates beau bridges and arthur kennedy and its fun to see the upcoming stars before they hit more recognizable feature films like kevin j oconnor the mummy and vincent donofrio men in black and law  order criminal intentone of my favorite shows its just one of those movies that stays with you
