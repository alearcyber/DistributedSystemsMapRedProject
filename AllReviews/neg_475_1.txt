NEG i just saw this movie last night at a midnight sneak preview screening i work for an independent theatre chain in colorado  its one of the perksim sorry but this is one of the worst movies ive ever seen i know that there are some bruce campbell fanatics out there who like star wars diehards will string you up from the nearest tree if you dare speak any ill of their beloved cinematic iconnevertheless campbellteers this particular work from the chin is a celluloid black holebr br before you make any assumptions that im some hoitytoity film buff who only watches real movies like ladies in lavender and sideways think again  im a huge fan of bmovies and bruce campbell in particular his trademark character ash is one of my favorites and his portrayal of the aging elvis in bubba hotep was phenomenalbr br but hey bmovies still have the potential to be reeeeally reeeeally bad and not in that good campy way we all loveand thats what watching this particular one was like for me and my fellow coworkers with the exception of that one tracking shot where bruce runs through the square and scares the kids there were no laughs to be had overall we found the story to be mindnumbingly stoopid the pacing mollasseslike and the socalled humor dumber than a bag of hammers im sorry but ted raimis pavel character was not comic reliefhe was just plain retarded believe me we all went into this really wanting to like it but left feeling incredibly disappointed and robbed of two hoursbr br if you absolutely loved this movie plan to see it multiple times want to marry and have kids with it etc thats fantastic  we all like what we like so you get no judgement from me but dont go questioning the sense of humor or fan loyalty of those who arent having multiple orgasms over campbells latest cinematic coupe this flick was a steaming turd sandwich in my humble opinionand as a true campbell fan im allowed to say that
