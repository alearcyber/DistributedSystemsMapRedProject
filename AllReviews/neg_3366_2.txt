NEG why did i have to go out and buy yes buy jack frost  revenge of the mutant killer snowman maybe it was a burst of temporary mental derangement but im guessing its because i kind of enjoyed the first jack frost it was a silly but funny horrorcomedy which had some okay effects by screaming mad george that and the fact that on the backcover of the sequel there was this nice picture of this guy impaled by this giant icicle coming out of his mouth with a lot of blood and all so i thought if its as idiotic as the first and has some nice splattergore in it it should be fun right well i was so dead wrong br br let me first say that the movie deserves some credit for having an immensely insane and retarded plot i mean a mutant killer snowman on a tropical island that spawns mutant killer baby snowballs which can only be killed or harmed by bananas as much as i love the premise i really hated the movie first of all while the first jack frost looked like an actual movie seemingly being shot on real film and all this sequel has the look and feel of a thirdrate soapopera it has this way too slick shotonvideo look the lighting is just plain awful bright white spots for the day look and stupid colors like blue and green at night the acting well dont even go there the dialogues range from stiff to extremely senile that jamaican man was just moronic saying man after every sentence and when it comes to the voice of the killer snowman all i could think of was a seventhrate chucky from childs play spewing dumb and supposedly witty oneliners before he kills someonebr br the best joke was were one guy asks why are you talking to your watch and the best scene was undoubtedly the one with that beautiful asian chick popping up out of nowhere and taking a swim in the pool totally naked thank god for that oh yeah and that little scene over the endcredits with those two japanese dudes on a miniature ship being badly dubbed had me laughing too but the worst thing about this movie was where was the gore and splatter action everyone is talking about there were plenty of occasions to show some decent gory killings a lot of people were killed off in original ways here but all offscreen like ive read in many other comments there were indeed nice setups to a head explosion a crushed body eyes being poked out tongue ripped out but on the crucial moments the editor cuts away to some blood splatters on the floor or nothing at all that frontal shot of that british guy being impaled from the backcover of the dvd wasnt even in the movie i only saw that particular killing filmed from the back meaning i didnt see sht i was waiting throughout the whole movie for that to happen and then i get to see nothing what a letdown could it be that i saw a cut version of the movie that would be a shame cause only a decent amount of splatterfun could have saved this movie if you ask me seeing a lot of killer snowballs reduced to bloody pulp just didnt cut it for me speaking of those snowballs they were done very poorly they made munchies look like stateoftheart animatronics but i guess that was the whole point of it at some point the special effects crew even turned to some laughably bad cgi boy you really have to see it to believe it best is to not see it actually cause this flick is just too bad okay i did laugh with it for it kept getting worse and worse just stick with the first jack frost  and youll be okay just bare in mind that its a pretty silly horrorcomedy but fun in its own rightbr br its funny but writerdirector michael cooney somehow must have realized that he was a pretty bad director after jack frost  and then focused on writing turns out he then wrote two pretty good thriller screenplays for the i inside starring ryan phillippe and identity starring john cusack so the man seems to have some talent after allbr br now it would be far too easy to give jack frost  the lowest rating possible so i say one point for that naked asian babe doing the skinny dipping and one point for those completely retarded snowball babies way to go mr cooney
