NEG dont buy this film for comedy value like i did i didnt find it one bit funny but so f miserable and lame its unbelievable i gave it to a friend for christmas which was pretty funny on my side i recently heard that he watched it and told me what an aehole i ambr br there is nothing more frustrating than watching an overlit over dramatic poorly scored scene in which the camera is sat there on a tripod and doesnt move the film work is truely pathetic and i can only say dont watch this movie
