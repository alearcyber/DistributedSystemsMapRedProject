POS i saw this movie back in  on a doublebill with valley of the kings these movies helped inspire a lifelong interest in egyptology in  i visited egypt seen today the egyptian suffers from flat dialog and a few gauche touches but its a glorious movie to look at  the sort of thing hollywood alas just doesnt do anymore  and it has a great story not just the usual boymeetsgirl or vengeanceismine affair too bad th wont reissue restored prints of this to be seen on the big screen
