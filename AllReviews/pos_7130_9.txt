POS just got back from the european premiere of the gamers dorkness risingbr br all i can say is that if you are a gamer crpg rpg or larp then this movie is for you and if youre not a gamer well its still a great deal of funbr br the acting is certainly not oscarworthy but in the whole element of the movie it adds to the charm the humour is everywhere along with some very nice touches the tribute to gary gygax is especially well done if you can spot it the cast are very down to earth in their appearance befitting the fact that they are ordinary people enjoying an ordinary hobbybr br the quality of the movies sound and vision are adequate but again it all just adds to the atmosphere that helps to define this movie as being the dungeons and dragons movie written and performed by gamers for gamersbr br not afraid to use terminology specific to one system they still manage to allow product placement to be a part of the movie but in a very understandable and utterly fair manner it also touches on some of the perceived prejudices that some gamers can have about other gamers and deals with that quite wellbr br all in all the movie is very much driven by an wellthoughtout equal balance of character plot and entertainment the bard is amazingly good valueformoneybr br in the end it does make scoring this movie quite hard so i have given it  scoresbr br score for nonrpers  a few moments could go way over your head but the main sections of the movie just work so hard and achieve so much morebr br score for rpers  everything fits together in the perfect quantities and with the perfect charm and sentiment
