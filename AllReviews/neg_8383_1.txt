NEG this film is a nightmare the sensation you feel when you wake up from a nightmare is the same i got when i finished watching this movie uffok it ended what a relief i felt pain watching this movie so bad it was its a bseries low cost movie thats for sure but i think it not an excuse to be so bad ive watched brilliant low cost movies with nice plots nice production nice acting and most of all some substance this one got nothing of it the plot is hilarious it almost seems like an american guide about how to transform ancient chinese mythology into a ridiculous teenage movie with some kids playing with the occult i dont know if the chinese tale present in this movie is real or not but if it is the damage is even worse the production is just horrible a plain zero what special effects are those theres no suspense the supposed tension scenes are a complete failure the acting is not better and what about the dialogs oh my god a movie which has for several times dialogs just like i will pass there later ok is that alright  ok alright  ok  ok alright bye then im sure it doesnt deserve more than a  scorebr br too bad to be true
