POS it is important and only fair to remember that at the time this short was produced a state of war existed between the united states and the empire of japan add to that the enormous illwill that the beginning of the war created as well as the bataan death march and other incidents and the only thing surprising about this short and others is that there werent more of them one other thing my only problem with this short is that it seems to try to be funny but it isnt im not sure that anyone connected with it really tried to make the jokes work or even cared it would have been far better if they had done what disney did with education for death and been totally serious but this short gets a bad rap and shouldnt be judged out of context the times were different then and that is an important consideration anyone expending energy trying to save the world from a sixtyyear old cartoon needs to take a step back as do i expending energy defending that same cartoon this should be available to interested parties even if not in wide circulation not a nice cartoon but sometimes life isnt nice recommended
