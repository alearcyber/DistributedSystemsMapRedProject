POS the entire movie an artful adaptation of one of joyces dubliners stories takes place on the night of january  epiphany  most of the film takes place at an annual party given by three spinsters two sisters and their niece where a group of upperclass dubliners gather for an evening of music recitations and dinner while there is very little plot per se the interaction and conversation among the group reveals much about dublin in the early th century when the stirrings for independence were just beginning the cast all talented irish stage actors with the exception of anjelica huston are universally wonderful and one actually feels he is a guest at the gathering himself the poignant final scene between ms huston and the amazing donal mccann reveals much about the marriage of the characters there is poignancy mixed with humor and insight and for those who like quiet thoughtful movies the dead is highly recommended my wife is from dublin we make a ritual of watching this wonderful movie every january th after many viewings it never fails to move me and each time i glean something that ive missed before
