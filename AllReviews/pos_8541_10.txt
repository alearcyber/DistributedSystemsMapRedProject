POS you know those films that are blatantly awful but you cant help but love them well thats what evil ed is possibly the best awful film in the world the sound is rubbish the dubbing is crap the screenplay is nonsense and the special effects are pap however i cant help but love this film dearly and i have recommended it to at least  people over the years sam campbell or the guy who plays him should be featured on the actors studio series as he is that memorable possibly the greatest movie villain not named tony montana seriously if you dont expect a lot then you wont be disappointed keep a lighthearted approach to watching this film and youll soon rate it a ten afterwards
