NEG while this is horribly dated i must insistplease no remake frankly it just wont help as theres nothing which could be added or changed contemporarily to make this cinematically betterbr br the novel upon which this is based was atmospheric well written truly spooky work but on film it just doesnt translate most of kings written masterpieces fail to translate to film im not sure why this is but when you view this work if you view it you are likely to see just what i mean br br the book its wonderful its not a masterpiece but its more than just entertaining br br the movie do something else you can thank me laterbr br it rates a  frombr br the fiend
