NEG im probably one of the few people who defend and even enjoy frisk the project that put todd verow on the map if that is indeed where he is i appreciated that someone had the guts to take on dennis cooper and not back away from the material verow fairly rolls around in it judging from what hes done since then hes wellsuited for that type of material and should probably stick to it vacationland a wouldbe teen coming out film is so misguided in so many ways it becomes unintentional comedy and im disappointed i have to report thatbr br first off our hero the high school senior joe is far too old in appearance to be playing   when we later meet a man who is supposed to be joes teacher its confusing as the sweatyfaced guy looks much younger than the student hes teaching joes mother looks younger than he does and doesnt act any older either second in joes opening scenes he looked like he was either playing or actually experiencing mental challenges to his credit he got better as the film went on and i figured out he was playing young but it just wasnt workingit was weirdbr br its  minutes in before anything is revealed about who what and where these people are and why we should care the second scene in the film is an extended bit of business in a mens toilet room that considering where the story goes later is absolutely superfluous the subplot with the teacher goes nowhere at all even as a rite of passage for our young heroone minute joe is nervously trying his hand at bathroom stall sex a scene so unerotic it makes you truly wonder what anyone sees in the practice the next minute hes an expert at sexual blackmail and violent doublecrossing this is followed by an extended scene with the character well later learn is andrew and thats about all we learn about him other than hes apparently gay but not out yetbr br theres a lot crammed in to the  running time which is about  minutes too longi cant imagine how it played with the mindnumbingly long and pointless deleted scenes of joe walking around a subplot copped from gods and monsters with an aged patron who spouts rhetoric appros pos of nothing played by an actor who obviously cant remember his lines he is conveniently dispatched with in a way dickens might have come up with on a slow week a mixnmatch almostfourway between the boys and their girlfriends a gaybashing toilet tramp a wouldbe wise sage in the form of a nellie queen and hasnt the nellie queen suddenly taken over the role of the hooker with the heart of gold as most tired stereotype who exists only to be degraded blackmail theft murder alcohol consumption and abuse of looping music software for soundtrack recordingbr br what you will not find in this movie are any interior establishing master shots were expected to imagine were in an airport grocery store office and classroom as all the scenes in these locations consist of closeups and poorly edited soundscapes to convey the idea of locales that the production must not have been able to afford one thing they were able to get appears to have been an actual gay bar either its the worst bar in the world or there are only about  gay men in bangor maine as the bar never has any patrons in it another good chuckle came when the actors were supposed to be yelling over dance music that very obviously wasnt coming from the speakers but was just more of the droning loopmusic of the scorebr br plots and characters come and go emotions are unreadable and the dialog clearly inspired by dennis cooper is filmspeak meaning no humans actually talk this way since we arent given any information about these characters its impossible to care about what happens to them its as if joe et al appear out of the ether one day and might simply cease to exist once the credits roll certainly the character of joes sister a wannabee jennifer grey who is bohemiacrazy seems to just simply stop we never know where she is in la or what her problem isbut againdoes it matter visually the film looks very good at times more a testament to new developments in hidef video than anything i suspect the editing is pretty clunky though there was one great edit joe is posing naked and says i wanted to play sports but and we cut to a shot revealing his butt ha ha composition is also odd at times i thought i was watching sctvs parody of persona when the boys were talking together in bed and visually it looked as if their noses were stuck together for the whole scenebr br one senses verow is really restraining himself from making a naughtier or somewhat rougher movie like he usually does and maybe he shouldnt have held back the frothy toothpastesex fantasy worked nicely i thought though the tone was out of touch with the rest of the moviehe produces and directs this sensitive coming of age story much like herschell gordon lewis directed films without goreporn films without sex in them i got some unintended laughs out of this and it wasnt boring it just wasnt very good either
