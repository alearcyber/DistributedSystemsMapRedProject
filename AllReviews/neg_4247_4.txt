NEG everyone i know loves this movie but i am afraid that i dont i hated this film so much that i had to turn it off midfilm because of the repulsion way too much time is spent on weepiness and emotional bedlam the point of the bullock character being devastated by her divorce is jackhammered into the viewers head excessively enough already and why didnt we hear more about her exhusband he is portrayed as nothing but a suit who comes by once in a while something must of made her want to marry him what was it what is it about him that makes her so devastated upon their divorce more time could of been spent on that rather than yet one more shot of bullock lying crumpled on the bedroom floor the dialogue is stilted cliched and terrible much like one of those corny abc afterschool specials or something there is no imagination or creativity about anything in this film it is all very predictable and therefore boring this movie also goes into overdrive on the cutsiness factor very stupid and not funny like it was supposed to be this is just another one of those horribly done i am woman hear me roar films much like waiting to exhale if you want to see i am woman hear me roar films that are truly entertaining original and welldone then see gas food lodging or ruby in paradise skip this crap i give hope floats
