NEG its a pity to throw away such a good idea the main idea of the movie is travel into past lives which  fortunately  is not a time travel but a journey inside man which has nothing to do with the past or the future maybe they shouldnt be called past lives at all in the film now that i think of it another minus i guess its all in the present in a different space very interesting without causing much religious distressbr br however the music is totally repetitive melodramatic sentimental and out of place not to mention western there should have been more variety and more thought on where there should be music and where there shouldnt the flashback romantic scenes take a lot of space and running time and are totally unnecessary the acting is not bad although the language has kept me from understanding betterbr br i believe the idea needed a little more thought developing and unfoldment the inside scenes could have had better background settings because in many cases they seem unreal as a whole i would say that this movie leaves a lot to be desired
