NEG in another of the dreadful horror films i seem so masochistically attracted to we have a bunch of friends stuck in a haunted house slowly being killed one by one thanks to a horde of zombies that spurt yellow blood and have very bad dental problems the first  minutes is all talk however and considering the young thespians cannot act their way out of a paper bag and are given the most banal dialogue ever to dispassionately recite this is especially painful to sit through if you manage to stay awake through that nonsense things dont get any better with bad makeup galore and cheesy bargain basement notsospecial effects as for the conclusion well whats the betting that the oldtimer who warned them against going to the spooky mansion in the first place will turn up and save the day for the last two survivors a boy and a girl of course with his mystical powers please life is too short for these kind of movies donate the time you would otherwise have spent watching this tripe helping out the community do a couple of shifts in a soup kitchen or something youll feel youve actually done something productive with your life and you wont have put money into the pockets of studios who churn out irredeemable rubbish such as thisbr br unfortunately its already too late for me now where did i put that copy of pumpkinhead
