POS subspecies like many other horror films gets a raw deal on imdb the majority of moviewatchers have a hearty contempt for horror and when they occasionally rent horror films they either want to laugh at them or cringe at excessively gory scenes unfortunately subspecies is not particularly laughable and not that bloody so it gets a low rating thats too badbr br of course theres plenty to criticize here the nonactors are flat the subspecies are a poor special effect and the nighttime scenes are too brightly lit but what do you expect for a straighttovideo horror film subspecies boasts decent production values and more integrity than you might anticipate the films romanian setting is virtually unique i believe it was the first american movie made in that country postcommunism and the locations both interior and exterior are beautiful the script has moments of intelligence especially when it delves into local folklore all bogus im sure somehow the location filming and smartish script work well together  subspecies has its own very distinctive world to risk damning with faint praiseit could be a lot dumberbr br fans of the more gruesome aspects of horror will no doubt get a kick out of the blooddrooling vampire villain radu hes pretty effective in this movie  powerful with a memorable raspy voice  but i like him better in the sequels when actor anders hove gives a more selfparodying campy performance a totally sincere radu is somewhat silly other silly aspects include gratuitous nudity and the subspecies themselves who are clearly only in the movie because producer charles band has a fetish for evil little creatures see also puppetmaster and demonic toysbr br but i linger too much on the movies flaws for what it is  straighttovideo vampire horror  subspecies is perfectly fine the sequels boast better production values more violence and somewhat more thoughtful story lines so i recommend them even more highly still this isnt a bad start for the series
