NEG the authors know nothing about russians prisons the movie is absolutely cockamamie has nothing common with the reality they also dont that the foreign prisoners in russia have a special prison so the foreigners never live together with russian criminals the uniforms in this movie look if they were stolen somewhere in latin america prisoners in russia also dont work outside the prison each kill in russian prison is a subject of investigation so the prisoners kill each other only if there some very important reasons playing soccer is also forbidden in the prisons contacts between the prisoners are very restricted no chance for bloody combats etc etc etc so this movie has nothing common with the reality
