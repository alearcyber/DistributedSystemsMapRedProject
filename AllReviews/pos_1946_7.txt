POS although i was hoping that id like it a little more this was still certainly an impressive film there were great performances by all the leads and the story while not what id call chilling was still effective and it kept me interested for me the best part of this film was the look of the picture for it always looked cold and damp and it just really seemed to suit the film well i also thought that the low budget suited this movie for i dont think that a crisp picture and clear sound would have worked as well in a film this grim all things considered it fell a little short of my expectations but im still very glad that i finally sat down to watch this movie
