NEG rarely have i seen an actionsuspense movie that was so boring none of the action scenes are exciting the story line is nothing special and except for a couple of actors the acting is bad charlie sheen platoon major league stars as the white house chief of staff who gets himself in the middle of a conspiracy that wants him and more people dead donald sutherland a time to kill fallen plays a friend who he tells everything he can and linda hamilton linda hamilton terminator dantes peak plays a reporter who gets involved in the situation charlie sheen is ok as the star donald sutherland is a good actor who gives a good performance linda hamilton gives a poor performance with a bad movie i can actually like it if it has a good ending but this movie has a very cheesy ending with some almost laughable stuff
