POS its not often that a tv series grabs me right off the bat a recent chance download of the pilot for surface had me glued to my seat for the entirety of the episode after which i immediately set out on a fevered search to learn everything i could about this wonderful series to my chagrin i found out it had been canceled after a mere  episodes despite its strong ratings and extremely favorable reviews such a shamebr br since then ive acquired the remaining episodes and found the first  or  to be among the best television ive ever watched just fantastic from start to finish and as another reviewer commented i loved how they ended every episode with a huge finish i imagine watching it each week i wouldve been screaming with tension and just captivated desperately waiting for the next episode to be released growing up i always heard that was how early serial movies used to do it ending with a huge cliffhanger to get the crowds back into the theater for the next episodebr br well it seems for some reason or another the suits decided to kill this off and apparently the people behind the show mustve seen the writing on the wall because after episode  things definitely take a turn for the worse i wouldnt say the episodes actually become boring but a lot of the plot elements become a bit more clichd and ive got to say the final episode really left me feeling cheated i just wish the shows creators were given a fair chance the only other show that left me feeling like that was the first season of stargate sg which just resonated tremendously feeling very true soulful and made from the heart surface was a great series and maybe one day some wellheeled tv lover will see all the outpouring of emotion about the shows cancellation and bring back this show one can hope at least
