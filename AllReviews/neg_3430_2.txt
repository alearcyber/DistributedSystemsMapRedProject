NEG other than john krasinski this movie was absolutely terrible the lacey chabert and andrew keegan love story was as clichd as possible full of unbelievably bad lines about how her parents wouldnt ever let them be together and superhammy longing looks none of the emotion had any depth or reality whatsoever the two accentedcharacters dean edwards as rupert and whoever it was playing the gun expertonce they saw how bad the accents were couldnt they have decided to just drop them and rewrite a couple of lines to avoid giving the audience headaches apparently not i dont even know where to start with the editing particularly the sound editing if you hate obvious overdubbing as much as i do dont watch this that being said krasinski was great off the bat ill admit that im a huge office fan and thats why i rented this but hes quite entertaining as the offthewall friend with crazy ideas hes got a clichd role but he still manages to make it as entertaining as possible the ending was awful just flat out terrible the idea of the robbery gone awry had potential but keegan floundering around after being shot all the way to his studio to fall ontop of a painting of chabert which looks nothing like her is the most cringeworthy scene
