POS well what do you know i was painting my house today and an elton john song came on the radio which immediately took me back to this movie which i saw in  so long ago and so far away ten years later i hitched hiked through the country side of france and i sure would have been keen to see michelle the film is probably not very sophisticated by todays standards mores the pity but it seemed rather racy back then a few years later a sequel was made with michelle living in a high rise in paris and paul coming back to meet her just like life they had moved on the film was very downbeat still the original was fab and if you can get a copy go rent it just remember to give it its due and treat it gently i note americans can be rather prudish so take note contains scenes and themes possibly upsetting to middle america
