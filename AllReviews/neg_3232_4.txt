NEG corey haim plays a kid who teams up with a dog to take out a giant troll and osa hitman michael ironside with a  and homemade bombs which plays plausible considering haim oh and he also protects his mother and girlfriend as well in this watchable yet disappointing adaption of a decent story corey haim is terrible of course but the movies sheer momentum as well as ironsides imposing presence make this at least a modestly effective film still the plot is ridiculous and it wouldve been nicer if we couldve seen a monster or at least more gore at least its something different also its fairly likely that this film will be the last teen movie for awhile to show a teenager making pipe bombsbr br matt bronson
