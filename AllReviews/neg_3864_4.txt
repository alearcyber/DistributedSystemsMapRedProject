NEG this is the first time i feel the need to comment on imdb to write some sort of a review and as it so often happens its not because of a really excellent film but a truly appalling onebr br take the narrating style the youngest might relate to the max payne video game series a cast of virtually unkonwns which is not a bad thing in itself poor dialogs some dark scenes but not many enough and make a film out of it dont worry about the bad acting the length way too long the lack of immersion the lead character has to be one of the lest interesting ive seen in a long time  couldnt care less if he died or the often ridiculous solutions they find to certain problems the lead character finds himself inbr br i wouldnt have written anything if it hadnt been for another review here giving it  stars i gave it four but maybe three is closer to what i feel about it not only do i not wish to see it again but the mere thought of it takes me dangerously close to wanting to kill myself oh and a so called noir film is nothing without a good soundtrack  not the case here the ending song sounds like it was more suitable to a western moviebr br its not romance its not action its not noir its not good that would be my review if it werent for the minimum of  lines
