POS this is definitely one of the better mel brooks movies along with spaceballsalthough i will openly admit to not having watched many others at least yet its very silly and thoroughly funny there are hardly more than a few minutes throughout the entire two hour runtime where you arent entertained almost all of the gags have a great comical effect few of them fall flat i saw this movie right after seeing and reviewing spy hard and comparing these two spoof movies i realize exactly of how high quality this movie really is its funny from start to finish none of the comedy is overdone or boring the music is marvelous as is the choreography of both dancing and fighting the acting is pretty much what you would normally expect from this type of movie elwes is a great comedian and makes a good robin the plot is typical robin hood more or less everything from the legend is fit into this movieand spoofed majorly if you like mel brooks or youre just a fan of silly humor or youre just dying to watch a good parody of the legend of robin hood this is definitely the film for you the hbo first look special on the film is also worth watching and in that you may want to keep watching throughout the credits too id recommend it to any fan of mel brooks movies and to people who enjoy silly humor
