NEG sayles had a very interesting film on his hands with silver city however it somehow became very muddied as it progressed from beginning to end chris cooper did an exceptional job embodying the essence of his character a dubya of sorts but he wasnt nearly given enough screen time instead we find ourselves on a rampage with a character that felt less personal less developed and overall too confusing the path that this danny huston leads us on inevitably becomes the downfall of the film too many characters are introduced to us in such a short time these characters randomly were involved with the progression of the plot which became too convoluted with each passing minute sayles knew what he was creating i just feel as if it wasnt being translated well to the silver screenbr br sayles is a master of his trade his films continue to inspire and evoke thought even if they are not commercial successes the trouble with silver city is that i think he found himself going too deep with not enough money or time to explain it all at the beginning of the film i had an idea of what was happening but as more and more characters were introduced as more and more plot twists tried to occur i lost the sense of the film by the ending while the ending was very clever and very dark i needed more explanation i think some of the reason that i lost my train of thought with this film was due to the casting of danny huston as our guide he was pathetic i didnt seem him as very exciting person to lead us on this adventure he seemed to go through the motions but not really accomplish much at all this was the first downfall of sayles important filmbr br while i will admit that the characters played by richard dreyfuss miguel ferrer james gammon and daryl hannah were interesting i just needed a better guide to help me understand their roles in this political scandal danny huston just did not cut it for me outside of the characters sayles needed a stronger script i sometimes felt that unless i was deeply rooted in the political world some of the references were well over my head the entire reasoning for silver city to be built and the corruption behind it eluded me i am a simpleton that loves advanced films but this one just didnt make much sense to me there were several times that i found myself asking why instead of seeing the whole picture i felt as if the individual stories were as clear as glass yet the whole picture was dusty and murky at the same time sayles needed to concentrate more on the bigger picture instead of these smaller issues which ultimately fogged this filmbr br perhaps i went into this film with the wrong idea i was expecting to see another version of primary colors but instead witnessed something less heartfelt and more technical without giving the ending away i thought that the final scene was one of the most beautiful moments in political cinema history the brilliant symbolism has stayed in my mind for the past two days after watching this film while the rest of the movie quickly shuffled away from my mind maybe a second viewing would do better for me but for some odd reason silver city just didnt click with me there seemed to be too many loopholes that were never explained or accounted for an ensemble piece is always good with me but when the characters are introduced without explanation it just looses steam this was one of those rare occasionsbr br overall i was very upset with this film being very democrat i wanted to see a side of politics that i wasnt aware of and another side that would make you chuckle i wanted to be engulfed with the world of corporate money and the dufus that are elected i wanted intelligent humor framed by the words of george w but instead all i found was a very confusing story aimed at a certain audience of which i will never be a part sad this picture had so much wasted promisebr br grade  out of
