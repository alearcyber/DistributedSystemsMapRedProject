NEG this film was utterly horrible stupid premise and horrible acting by all whoever wrote this trash should be hanged reminds me of a hack student film but worse who ever produced this should give up now i know opinions are subjective and all and some may think this fantastic as some think dune  was fantastic well get off your horse and watch some real films ok the acting was tolerable and with better direction could have been far better but it didnt so it suffers i dont know how much more i can say about this waste of film other than to totally trash it anyways it was horrible and i recommend to avoid it like the plague if you come anywhere near dreamland rent the movie beside it instead
