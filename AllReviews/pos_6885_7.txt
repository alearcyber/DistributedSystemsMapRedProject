POS i wandered into blockbuster with a friend the other night having decided that we were too broke and too lazy to do active she decided she wanted to watch closer which seemed like such a repellant idea that i had to rent another film for once shed gone to bed looking around i didnt see much that interested me but saw the doll master in the new releases section just based on the cover sleeve a woman with a dolllike face crying tears of blood i thought this would be interesting enough to rentbr br as for the film itself watching it in an almost empty house with all the lights turned off it was pretty scary i must admit ive always had a bit of a phobia of dolls since i was a kid and watched an awful film called asylum one of the stories in it involved a mental patient creating a doll which killed people lame but scary at the time and the first three quarters of this film really hit the spot for me the first half hour in particular was awesome the creepy foreboding atmosphere really set the scene well and without moving the dolls seemed genuinely threatening but unfortunately as soon as they did start to move it all got a bit cheesy i was a bit disappointed when moments that could have been genuinely frightening made me laugh because of the way they were filmedbr br as for the characters its a horror film youre not really expecting anything memorable i found i remembered names and faces better than most asian horror films ive seen which suggests there must have been some hidden character development that i didnt consciously notice the typical stereotypes are out in force in this movie each one having some kind of character quirk that sets them apart from the others from shy and quiet yeongha and her doll damien to the outgoing bimbo seonyeongbr br the plot itself was fairly cool even though the ending which bought together many of the loose strands of plot seemed a bit confused and didnt really do anything for me although it did have a couple of really cool plottwists that i wont ruin here the basic plot is a bunch of kids are invited to be modelled as dolls by a famous reclusive old doll maker they have to stay in the creepy house adorned with scary dolls some big some small and things start to happen as our heroine haemi starts to explore areas of the house and things start happening to the other inhabitantsbr br overall i would definitely recommend the film not to watch with too many people as some of the moments would probably make you laugh if surrounded by friends but as something too watch on your own in the dark with the windows and doors open just a bit just in case any dolls feel like watching with you it really does leave you guessing for most of the film allowing you to go off on wild conspiracy theories only to completely destroy them later on if you really get into it and ignore its cheesiness in places i can guarantee youll check under your bed before you go to sleep and maybe even leave the lights onbr br or maybe thats just me p as for closer it was ok but i preferred this
