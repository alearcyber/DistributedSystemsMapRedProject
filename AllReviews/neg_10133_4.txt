NEG describing this film is a difficult task on the one hand its an overthetop vampire spookfest complete with cobwebs eerie music a hypnotic medallion and of course a coffin with a creaky lidbr br on the other hand this is one of the silliest scripts this side of edward d wood jr produced by the same people who gave us the bloody vampire invasion of the vampires and this films predecessor the modestlytitled the vampire the movie sticks close to the lack of logic that characterizes the other filmsbr br as i mentioned this film is a sequel to the vampire which i have not seen but no matterits real easy to imagine what happened dr enrique played by abel the brainiac salazar is befuddled when the wellintentioned but misguided dr marion brings back the staked body of his vampiric enemy count karol de lavud i suppose there is a rule somewhere that all vampires must be counts of some sort dr marion complains that all important doctors throughout history have had to resort to some sort of grave robbing in order to advance their medical studies and he hopes to use the vampires corpse to study such phenomena as the vampires lack of a normal reflection at which point he holds a mirror up to the vampire and instead of no reflection we see the vampires skeleton br br enrique is not pleased and seems determined to pass off the events of the first film as mere fantasy and superstition this man was no vampireill admit that he liked to drink a little blood but thats all he states also confusing matters is the fragile martha a parttime nurse and parttime showgirl  who happens to be enriques object of affection martha narrowly escaped de lavuds clutches in the first film and apparently enrique has spent a great deal of time healing her mind and getting her to think that everything that she experienced was not realbr br ok so if you were the scriptwriter for this film you would need a way to get someone dumb enough to pull the stake out of the vampire right well how about the greedy con man who helped marion steal the coffin after getting a glimpse de lavuds body he sets his sights on the expensivelooking brooch that the count is wearing and he conveniently returns to steal it when the doctors arent looking but darn ithe cant remove the brooch because of the stake soyou guessed it de lavud is on the loose again this time with the shady con as his human henchmanbr br ok so of course the vampire is after martha again and meanwhile the doctors are really confused about what they believe at first they are determined to prove that there is no such thing as a real vampire then by the end of the film they are trying to get the police to put an allpoints bulletin out for a man who is dead but still alivebr br you can probably imagine the rest of the plot from here but the filmmakers do throw in a few pleasing twists one of the sets for the movie is a spooky wax museum is there any other kind in these types of films complete with a fullyequipped torture chamberwith real torture and execution equipment the movie has a very keen sense of style and not just in the campy cobwebs one effectively creepy sequence has de lavud chasing a victim down a seemingly endless series of streets and alleyways following their progress alongside vague buildings with no doors while lighting the scene like a german expressionist nightmare the cabinet of dr caligari seems to be an influencebr br but the rest of the film is juvenile particularly in the films climax the special effects are quite crude even for the year that this was made and the climactic fight with de lavud in bat form is laughable enoughbut the director feels the need to ask us to believe that martha would faint and collapse directly over top of a guillotine positioned so that her head was in the perfect location to be chopped off by the blade which is in danger of falling because the restraining rope has suddenly begun to fray right at that very minute what an unfortunate coincidence to make matters worse he cuts away from the fraying rope to scenes of enrique trying to dodge the swooping rubber bat basically standing still and waving his arms around its definitely an ed wood moment if ever there was one especially when martha seems to revive on her own and rises groggily to her feet just as the blade slams down whew what a relief in terms of kookiness the vampires coffin does not have the lunacy factor of the bloody vampire or invasion of the vampires but fans of these types of old horror films will appreciate the atmospheric photography and the fact that the director manages to wring some real chills from this material has to count for something haw haw
