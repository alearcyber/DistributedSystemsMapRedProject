NEG i suppose that in  hollywood wasnt quite at the point of openly celebrating homosexuality so one might want to give some credit to those who put this movie together for having shown a little bit of courage one simply wishes that credit could be given them for having put together a really good movie and in my opinion in  out doesnt qualify on that count its the story of howard brackett kevin kline  a small town high school english teacher who on the eve of his wedding is outed by a former student who happens to win an oscar and who then has to go through what can only be described as a period of selfdiscovery as he comes to terms with being homosexual to me that was the first problem with this movie howard didnt really have to turn out to be gay the movie would have been funnier and perhaps even more thought provoking had brackett remained defiantly straight in spite of the stereotypically gay aspects to his life and the towns belief after the oscar speech that he was gay in fact i thought that identifying him as gay given the presence of those stereotypes might actually have been rather insulting to the gay community as well as to straight men who like poetry and believe in dressing neatly br br kline was decent enough in the role and largely carried the film aside from him most of the other cast members although fine actors were people not really noted for their success on the big screen folks like tom selleck and wilford brimley and bob newhart are good actors but not big movie stars i actually thought that the funniest if very small role in the movie was that of the super model sonya played by an actress named shalom harlow speaking of stereotypes i loved her ohso stereotypical model line i promised to do that photo shoot this afternoon i have to shower and vomit in the end what really turned me off about this movie was the ridiculous ending starting with the graduation ceremony and to be honest even if someone decided that the graduation was really necessary the movie should have ended there rather than proceeding on with the totally unnecessary nuptials at the end br br basically i got a few chuckles out of this but nothing more
