NEG stmd is not a terrible movie but it is quite forgettable the lighting is intentionally poor in many scenes and unintentionally poor in all the rest so you are likely to come out of a viewing with a headache or eyestrain special effects are imaginative but obvious the gratuitous nudity essential for teen slasher flicks is there of course along with the archetypical teenagers but the whole movie just doesnt gel what was needed was some snappier dialogue and more tongueincheek humorbr br i cant really recommend that you use your time watching this movie i often give a nod to a movie based on just a scene or two that demonstrates imagination or humor but these are sadly lacking in this film
