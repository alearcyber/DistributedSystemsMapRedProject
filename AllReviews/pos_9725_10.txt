POS this is the best television series for children and adults ever john hurt is a great actor with many excellent performances over many years but he was born to play the storyteller the scripts for almost every episode are superb pieces of craftsmanship and the productions run the gamut of the emotions being alternately funny sad happy exciting and always hauntingly beautiful it is hard to pick a best episode from so many excellent contenders but the soldier and death with its timeless pathos is unbeatable it is a series to watch with your children over and over again
