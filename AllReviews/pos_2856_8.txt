POS betty sizemore renee zellweger lives her life through soap opera a reason to love as a way to escape her slob husband and dull life after a shocking incident involving two hit men morgan freeman and chris rock betty goes into shock and travels to la believing that she is destined to marry the shows main character greg kinnearbr br nurse betty is that rare thing a lesser known film with an allstar cast and a fluffy romcom plot that surprises with its terrific script and spot on acting indeed such a plot makes one question the r rating but its warranted all right the shocking incident that sends betty over the edge is a tad too graphic compared to the light amusing comedy that is to come and feels like something out of a different movie but at the same time it is necessary to believably show bettys transformation into the doe eyed lovable nut job she becomesbr br as we go along with betty on her journey director neil labute works some extraordinary magic which makes the movie unique and high above your bog standard comedy of error an example of this would be bettys first meeting with her crush she pours her heart out to him and he plays along thinking shes auditioning for a part on the show even as we are aware of the ludicrous nature of bettys ramblings the music swells as she speaks giving us the audience bettys emotional perspective we almost believe what she is saying yet we understand that her mind is fractured whereas other filmmakers would try to accent the ridiculousness of the situation to wring every ounce of possible comedy out of the scene labute is sensitive to his main character and treats her with the utmost sympathy and understandingbr br the banter between the hit men played by freeman and rock is priceless the excellent script doling out clever line after clever line for them to riff off of freeman in particular is excellent as always pacing himself as his character slowly and blindly falls in love with his own ideal of betty not even truly knowing who she is or what has happened to her aaron eckhart once again shows versatility in the thankless role of bettys nogood husband and he is almost unrecognisable the other revelation here is kinnear whose portrayal of the soaps star is not too overcooked theres a tendency to lay on the celebrity bastard clich as thickly as possible and kinnear resists instead imbuing him with a pompous yet restrained self importance despite simply being a soap starbr br the soap opera is realised so well it could almost exist labute and co hit the nail on the head with this one and a good thing too if the soap opera had been too satirical a large part of the film would not have worked to do a days of our lives spoof as seen in friends would have been the wrong move for this movie the dedication to detail pays off as the style and feel of the soap opera begins to bleed into bettys reality more and more while keeping with the overall unintentionally comedic aspect of the genre the scenes on the set feel real as opposed to some films in which the atmosphere feels so manufactured you wondered why people who do it for a living cant get it rightbr br the neat resolution of the final act while being a tad predictable is wholly satisfying overall its a shame that after labute directed this wonderful film the mainstream came calling for him to direct the abysmal remake of the wicker man a fine example of a man so totally above the material given to him unfortunately one cannot absolve him of all responsibilitybr br if you havent seen nurse betty its something to discover if you have its worth a revisit there is a charm to nurse betty that is infectious even if it may not leave you thinking that much afterwards a hidden gem nonetheless
