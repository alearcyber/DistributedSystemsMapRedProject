POS spoiler alert please dont read if you dont want the movie spoiledbr br i was originally planning on seeing this movie this past weekend but my plans ended up making me unable to have time to see it so me  my friend made plans to see it after school today boy are we glad we did the movie starts off in italy with a planned heist with a group of guys charlie croker mark whalberg steve frezelli edward norton lyle also known as napster seth green youll get the nickname later handsome rob jason statham left ear mos deaf  john bridger donald sutherland plan a heist to steal  gold bricks this leads to the whole opening which is a good  to  minutes and involves a boat chase which opens the movie up right while driving away in their get away van steve frezelli turns on the group steals the gold and kills john bridger who is pretty much the retiring leader of the group fast foward to a year later where where stella bridger charlize theron johns daughter is one of the top safecrackers that anyone can ask for charlie croker who was actually indirectly responsible for her fathers death as he called him out of retirement for the heist says that theyve found steve who has gone into hiding and want to get back at him for what he did she at first declines but later agrees and the teamgets back together along with getting the help of wrench franky g a mechanic to carry out the perfect heist while creating one of the largest traffic jams in los angeles history this movie is a perfect mix of action with funny bits thrown in throughout theres an onrunning joke about seth greens character lyle creating napster and how shawn fanning who makes a cameo stole it while he fell asleep and eventually lyle will only answer if refered to as napster theres even a funny line in the movie by seth who goes he said in an interview he called it napster because it described his hair like it was nappy he callled it that because i was napping when he stole it the begining and ending sequences are pure genius and everything in between fits perfectly the only negative thing i can think of with the movie is that edward nortons acting was a bit weak he wasnt a big tough bad guy he acted like he was being paid and just doing the bareminimum which is a fact as he was forced to do this movie due to contractual obligation but even with that problem being the only real gripe with the film the movie is still very enjoyable and i definetly recommend seeing it and even if youre not interested in the actual movie go to see seth green shine in the comedic role hes perfect rating  out of
