NEG sometimes i wonder if todays horror movies rely on human torturing to make people scared if so then theres a sad future for horror movies dee snyder tries to make you feel scared and terrified this movie does exactly this but not in a good way now there are some moments in the film where that there is a chance that snyder is saving this film from falling into a hole but lets be frank this movie didnt fall into a hole it was already in a hole and synder makes no attempt whatsoever to bring itself out of it when you finish watching this movie you are left sick depressed dirty and insane i have a feeling that was the intention of this movie what is lower than dirt
