NEG i happened to catch this supposed horror flick late one friday night i wish id gone to bed tell me is a  ft tall raincoatclad twerp on a gurly bike supposed to convey some sort of fear not here yet milow is still able to beat the crap out of the janitor antonio fargas who is three times his size uhhuh and the ending is so pitiful it just leaves you hanging with nothing to go on whatsoever i found myself asking is that itbr br acting is about as good as itll get in a low budget film the aforementioned fargas delivers a decent performance but it is my conclusion that jennifer jostyn maybe one of the worse actresses to ever strut into tinsel town sure cute face but bad actingbr br rating
