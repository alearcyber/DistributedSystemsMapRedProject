POS it may be a remake of the  film by capra but it is wrong to consider it only in that way it was supposed to expose hiltons novel in a completely different way as a musical is excellent the scenery is terrific the characters good and anyone like leonard maltin who considers the bacharach music awful must be completely deaf i strongly recommend it
