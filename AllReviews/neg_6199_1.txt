NEG i watched this movie only coz it was expected to be yet another entertainer by david dhawan br br bad bad comeback by david dhawanhe has made lots of funny movies in past which made no sense but none of them was a crap bag what a waste of talent and beauty it wasdonno why actors agree on doin movie like thisbr br there was not a whit of practicality in this moviethe movie is below par and not at all justifies the standard and potential bollywood hasbr br the only thing worth watching in this movie was katrina but we dont need to watch a movie like this to see her being a remake of hollywood flick hitch its clear that bollywood directors cant even make a proper remake i consider this to be the worst ever movie i hv seen awful
