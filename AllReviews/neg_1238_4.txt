NEG im not sure this review contains spoilers but im playing it safe by indicating there might be regardless its unlikely anyone will watch this film who isnt familiar with the bookbr br theres an old wisecrack about laboring mightily and bringing forth a mouse comanche moon is such a mousebr br the novel focuses more on the indians than the americans in adapting it for tv mcmurtry and osanna rightly reasoned that the audience would be more interested in the whites than the reds unfortunately theres little in the novel that we dont already know about gus woodrow and their friends so the movie gives us mostly a portentous prehash of what will occur in lonesome dove the indians  who have their own story to tell  are largely relegated to the background  so much so that someone who hasnt read the novel will rightly wonder why its titled comanche moonbr br the novel has no overall story line or much of a point this could have been fixed in the movie by more strongly drawing the contrast between the indians losing their lands and way of life to the encroaching americans who bring civilzation this opportunity was missedbr br unlike lonesome dove comanche moon has few extended scenes that develop character or relationships  at least among the americans the extended scenes with the indians have been largely removed or shortened and for a net fourhour film it is remarkably episodic and choppy one gets the feeling the script was originally longer and cut to reduce the production costsbr br the screenplay comprises mostly clichd dialog aphorisms and platitudes coming from the author of the last picture show its a startlingly bad script mcmurtry and osanna had the opportunity to fix problems with the story and characterizations but did notbr br some of the best dialog from the novel is missing or altered for no obvious reason for example clara cassie shows her intense hatred of woodrow jack by condemning gus ennis for always running off to be with his pard that tart little revelation of claras sexual jealously is gone then theres the scene where the urdense woodrow warns maggie not to let jake spoon compromise her the exchange in the novel is shorter and harsher the film tones it down and doesnt portray woodrow as quite the socially stupid emotionally frozen stone he is when i read that scene in the novel i wanted to punch woodrow in the stomach  or worse there are other changes some of them understandable inish sculls eyelids are not cut off to do so would like have required expensive cgi but buffalo hump has no hump perhaps it was felt unreasonable to ask wes studi to schlep around such a huge prosthesis and buffalo humps character is kindler and gentler he is nowhere nearly as grotesquely violent as he was in the novelsbr br the only good thing about this nearturkey is steve zahns remarkable performance  not so much as gus mccrae but as robert duvall playing gus mccrae it is uncanny he perfectly duplicates duvalls mannerisms and manner of speech without ever appearing deliberate or selfconscious as was duvall he is wholly within the character and he actually shows us gus becoming more gus in the third partbr br the best thing about comanche moon is that it wont spoil our affection for lonesome dove not just a great western but a great american filmbr br ps for those who think rachel griffiths was over the top  thats the way she was in the book
