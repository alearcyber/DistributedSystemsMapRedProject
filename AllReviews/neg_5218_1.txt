NEG when you watch the making of with this dvd  they tell you what is attempted here they are retelling the bible story of good versus evil  trying to preach it to a main stream movie audience in a modern society such as ours this is where the film fails there are way too many sheep depicted in this movie people are too empowered for this type of preaching todaybr br as far as the acting directing  technical functions they are done ok chuck norris actually is ok as an angel as the unpredictable appearance of norris as an angel is no more absurd than tommy smothers was in the s sit com
