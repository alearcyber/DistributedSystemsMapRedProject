NEG this is yet another pseudointellectual lets make the nazis look real bad movie the nazis were pretty bad no doubt  most of already know that however that does not necessarily make every movie on the theme good a discovery channel presentation of the wannsee conference would have been much more interesting br br conspiracy falls on its ass between two categories documentary and drama it doesnt cut it as a documentary the movie is too staged and the presentation too common it doesnt cut it as a drama the characters are too shallow and conflicts too easily solvedbr br another thing is the tagline one of the greatest crimes against humanity was perpetrated in just over an hour as the movie shows the wannsee conference the meeting had nothing to do with reaching a consensus on the final solution the decision on the solution had already been taken by the ss the sole purpose of the meeting was to make all significant stakeholders commit themselves to an already established plan there were no decisions or plans made at the wannsee conference there was only threats and coercion some needed less than othersbr br finally one thing the movie does show although in no exceptional manner is man has a tendency to turn to culture and aesthetics in an attempt to hide for himself the fact that he is committing appalling atrocities this is seen in most powermongering leaders and politicians
