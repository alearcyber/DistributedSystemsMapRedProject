POS in hoot a new kid arrives to florida from montana he first faces the usual problems of blending in and dealing with the local bully soon though he becomes aware of a bigger problem a franchise restaurant chain is trying to build a site in the town right where a number of burrowing owls live this movie has the look of a family film but it is pretty more radical than it seems as it shows sympathetically how roy and a couple of friends do not shy away from lawbreaking including vandalism of private property and briefly kidnapping the manager of the chain of restaurants in the name of environmentalism to save owls no less now one might agree or not with those actions but at least the movie has the courage from not shying away from its convictions a good solid film all in all
