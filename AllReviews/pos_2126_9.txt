POS i feel that this movie is different from so many others in that it shows a family of girls who actually care about each other they may have faults but bitterness and putdowns have no place with these girls try to find that on tv or in the usual movies it is a breath of fresh air to see girls being femininewearing beautiful feminine dresses and shoes contrast that with the apparel in stores today ie raggedy and faded jeans and jackets etc the story line has an evil thread running through but that is what makes it more realistic and interesting i know that it is animated but it still gives you a feeling that families can stick together and come out okay i would recommend this movie for boys and girls alike
