NEG this movie was a complete disaster for me there is one thing that movies must have in order to be watchable and that is some psychological credibility of characters unfortunately here this is not the case the main characters behave irrationally most of the time and even if they have some reason for such behavior it is not revealed to us by the director sophie marceaus character is particularly irritating making pictures of everything throughout the whole movie when one could expect something more rational for example meeting with her mother in the hospital and why exactly did she marry this guy no this is not a spoiler the plot at times seems like ripped off some soapopera and while the actors performance is not bad this does not help much all in all i just could not find a way to connect with this movie not that i tried too much after the first hour though i have never walked out of cinema during a movie but this time was the closest in my life so far
