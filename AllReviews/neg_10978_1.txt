NEG i found it hard to care about these characters who were either annoying or insipid all living their fabulously hilariously urban livesbr br the dialogue was excruiciating at times and at other times the narrative seemed hard to follow  was it me or were entire scenes deletedbr br it felt like a poor sitcom somehow turned into a film the stereotypes and jokes about mens groups would perhaps have been funny in the early s as it is this is where much of the humour of the film comes from  and boy does it get old fastbr br apart from the attractive irish man  this film was a dud and not even in a so bad its good way the last  minutes were particularly painful perhaps if youve never met any gay people or never thought about homosexuality before then this film might have something meaningful to say otherwise  darlings youd still be better off renting the boys in the band or beautiful thing
