NEG i dont know if i hate this movie as much as i did when i watched it two weeks ago but if youre expecting the events described on the box forget it that would have been a good movie the great descent described on the box is nothing compared to the descent into utter dispair that i took viewing this movie if youve seen hbos taxi cab confessions this is the same thing only fictional and not even remotely as interesting if you really want to see something interesting about a cab driver check out the  minute short they run on encore from time to time it is actually worth watching i have never ever asked for my money back for a movie until i saw this  thing boring boring boring it does offer one unique trait which is this it leaves you to decide what happens to each of the passengers letting your imagination fill in the gaps which would be great if you actually cared about any of these people instead i found myself yelling at the screen weeping like a child praying for either the end of the movie or my own death the cab driver himself though well played considering runs through emotions seemingly at random from sarcastic to sympathetic to raging lunatic to apathetic sometimes it is appropriate most of the time its just a display for its own sake dammit i learned all these emotions in acting class and im gonna use them now that ive been thinking about it again i do hate this movie as much as i did
