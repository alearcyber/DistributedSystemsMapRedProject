NEG the first users comments are very detailed for a very vague movie not saying that i disagree but this summary can be written in a few sentences to get straight to the point this is pretty much like watching the making of a really bad amateur porno flick there are a few funny points in the movie but with the kind of things that happen in todays youth everyday its actually kind of lame the main actor in the movie is a pompous jackass and both guy and girl in the film are way too modest to be in a film like this do not waste your money on this movie the only reason why i gave it a  and not a  is that they used at least a somewhat attractive girl in the movie and towards the end you got to see almost full frontal nudity from the girl thats it thats the only thing thats worth watching it for the end
