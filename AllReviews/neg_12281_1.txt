NEG i had to write a review for this movie based on the ones that are saying gory non stop action great moviebr br these people were obviously watching a different movie killpoint honestly sucked from the word go i kept waiting and waiting for this film to get better and it was to no avail some said this movie was brutal and others said gory but i cant find either of those adjectives actually showing up in this i mean hell there are so many scenes with people getting shot and there being no blood at all its not even funny i guess the best way to sum this up is it probably shouldve been rated pg by  standards and now in the year  there is no doubt this would be pg bad bad not in the fun cheesy b variety movie
