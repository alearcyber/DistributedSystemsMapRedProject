POS yknow its very interesting watching this half the people involved with it are now deadbr br anyways its been a long time since ive watched anything muppet related but this stuff is pure gold im a great fan of puns and this movie has them quite well placed but one of the amazing aspects of it is its pacing its not really highspeed childrens pacing where the filmmakers just randomly decide to move the story along without giving the characters depth its just kind of moves along with the characters wherever they want to gobr br kermit the frog is just an awesome character his voice and the expressions on his puppetface are fantastic but above all he points out why hes popularhe can sing and make jokes toobut more appropriately why hes so endearinghe without any effort inspires everyone to search for their dreams in the meantime he also has to deal with himself which is an uncommon theme in family moviesbr br it also contains quite an ensemble of comedians making appearances here and there some to great effect others to a little less i think mel brooks part was just a bit overplayed do you some parts of the film are just kind of odd but its highly imaginative and takes itself to the same destination from a very different directionbr br moving right alongbr br polarisdib
