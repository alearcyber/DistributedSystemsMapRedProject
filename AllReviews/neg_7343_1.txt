NEG man alive is this game bad or what the graphics are way below par even if it were on a playstation  never mind a gamecube the gameplay is pathetic and the camera movements disorientating what a worthless gamebr br i totally love warners batman animation and its cool that they do all the games in this way batman vengeance could well have turned out great as they got off to a good start by keeping all the gothic visuals and voice actors but they seriously stumbled when it came to playability and graphics the result is a boring game that looks incredibly cheap and is no fun to play whatsoever i really must stress how bad the graphics are dont let the color schemes fool you ive seen better stuff on a commodore
