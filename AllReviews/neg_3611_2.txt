NEG george sluizer of the vanishing fame  he made both the haunting european original and the hollywood remake  directed crimetime  he shouldnt really be blamed for this confused  poor movie because all the problems lie in brendan somers script  its ill focused and lazily written  for instance the killer hangs around a nightclub waiting to pick up a victim  any victim and starts talking to a teenage girl  cut to the next scene where she tells the villain  ive told you everything about myself  tell me about your life   unfortunately the girl has told the baddie her life story off screen and is a terrible example of the screenwriter not being able to bring a character to life through dialogue  i know for a fact how bloody difficult this is but for a screenplay that is produced the writer should have tried harder br br its difficult to explain the message of the film  at some points it feels like its trying to be a british natural born killers satarising the medias voyeurism with crime  perhaps it even influenced the infamous video game manhunt  but the script isnt witty enough to carry this off  when youve got a sex scene that doesnt progress the plot or characters or hint of subtext you know youve got a badly written screenplay and crimetime is a badly written screenplay
