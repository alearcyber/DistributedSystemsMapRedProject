POS anyone who correctly identifies the opening images as god killing himself without reading the end credits certainly deserves a free ticket to a rest home in transylvania i would imagine this as being a favorite movie at twin peaks dark lodge on movie night if time existed there i would think that a better title might have been how much fun can you have with someone whos almost dead in the forest with only neolithic technology the answer it would seem is quite a bit so despite the silly god killing himself the uberpretentiousness an apt phrase taken from a previous letter the more clearly alistair crowley  hi im the beast deal with it than christian cosmology i cant believe another viewer had the thickheadedness to see the judeochristian bible in this despite all of that this is a daring important work that most people should not see i am both impressed and creeped out that it was made at all
