NEG the odd thing about galaxina is not that it is supremely bad although it is the odd thing is that in spite of being supremely bad it is not funny supremely bad movies have their own particular brand of unintended humorthe secret of their success you might say but galaxina is quite uniquely differentit is mstks worst nightmare a bad movie in which the intentional and the unintentional humor alike fall flatbr br it is easy enough to figure out why the intentional jokes failand the reasons are quite varied sometimes its a timing question sometimes its a good idea badly worked out the human restaurant could have been hilarious but it wasnt sometimes it feels like there was some mixup in the cutting room with the punchline ending up on the floor and sometimes the jokes are just bad jokes bad movies get their laughs from such unintentional snafus its harder to figure out why galaxina doesnt get any laughs on that count something is subtly wrong with the unintentional humor in this movie just as something is wrong not at all subtly with the intentional humor it is a supremely bad movie whose very badness is not the redeeming quality it usually is its absolutely unique in my experience
