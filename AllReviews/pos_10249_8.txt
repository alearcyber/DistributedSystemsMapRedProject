POS at the surface cooley high is a snappy ensemble comedy masquerading as a period piece set in the early s complete with a flawless motown soundtrack but theres so much more to this film  it gets better every time i see it the cast of unknowns at the time is excellent and it is notable as an allblackcast film that doesnt fall into any blaxpoitation clichs  at times cooley high almost feels like an updated urban neorealist film with lots of edgy humor added in at times the rather tight budget does show but the constraints actually serve the film well  theres a grit and honesty of emotion here that lends the film an immediacy lacking in most similarminded films like schultz later car wash which was more popular but largely pointless warmhearted but also truetolife this might be one of the sleepers of the s  celebrated at the time it seems that few film freaks know about this one today their loss  this is a fine fine filmbr br the barebones panandscan dvd no widescreen is testament to just how little caredfor this excellent film is
