POS i can only agree with many observers that traffik is one of the most memorable dramas ever made for television i saw traffik when it was on tv and i have just watched it again i am particularly moved by the haunting original music of tim souster and especially by the dolorous strains of dmitri shostakovichs chamber symphony in c minor  the music over the credits and in parts of the film the music intensifies the desperation of the characters as they pursue their sad fate the music is powerfully emotional this arrangement combines two of the movements from the symphony but i recommend listening to the symphony per se
