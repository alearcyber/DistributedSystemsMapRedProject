NEG although i can see the potentially redeeming qualities in this film by way of its intrigue i most certainly thought that the painfully long nature in the way the scene structure played out was too much to ask of most viewers enormous holes in the screenplay such as the never explained your father died today comment by the mother made it even harder to try to make sense of these charactersbr br this won first place at cannes in  which is a shock considering perhaps the french had been starved for film noir that year and were desperate for something as sadistic as this film i understood the long scenes as a device to keep the viewer as uncomfortable as possible but when matched with the inability to relate to the main character it went too far for me and kept me at arms distance from the story altogetherbr br this is a film for only the most dedicated fan of film noir and one who expects no gratification from having watched a film once its over i loved movies such as trainspotting or requiem for a dream  which were far more disturbing but at least gave the viewer something in the way of editing and pacing to watch this teachers slow and painful silence scene after scene just became so redundant that i found it tedious  and i really wanted to like this film at every turn
