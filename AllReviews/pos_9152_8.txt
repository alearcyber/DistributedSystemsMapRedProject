POS the beloved rogue is a wonderful period piece it portrays th century paris in grand hollywood fashion yet offering a bleaker side to existence there as it would be experienced by the poor and the snow its constantly swirling about adding to the severity of the setting  brilliant the setting is enhanced by the odd cast of characters including beggars cripples and dwarfsbr br a brilliant performance is turned in by john barrymore outdone only by the magnificent conrad veidt who portrays a degenerate dissolute louis xi to perfection and yes veidt picks his nose on purpose pushing his portrayal to wonderfully wry limits
