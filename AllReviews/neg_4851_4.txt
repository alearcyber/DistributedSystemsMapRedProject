NEG i do not see what is the whole deal about this movie patricia kaas sings yes and that makes the film charming but singing is not enough i mean if you want to get all benefits of this one go buy patricias cd and enjoy the plot is simple if to omit the dreams the main characters seem to love each other instantly and as well instantly forget their other acquaintances relationships appear almost mandatory and the little detective story thrown in just makes things worse what at first appeared to be a perfect movie ending is first screwed up and then comes out as just a dream i measure movies by how well i would remember them and for this one i already started to forget the details
