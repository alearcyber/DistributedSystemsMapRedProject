NEG not many people outside poland have had an opportunity to become familiar with andrzej sapkowskis brilliant writings hes very popular in poland for his fantasy short stories  i believe none of them has ever been translated intrto english alas to make a long story short wiedzmin  the main character of sapkowskis books  is a traveling monster slayer a man of extraordinary strenght and skill hes pretty much your favourite tolkienstyle cool guy unfortunately no one would figure this out after watching the film wiedzmin the movie is nothing but a collection of random scenes featuring wiedzmin and other characters from sapkowskis writings but not eben remotely resembling the plot and dramatic pace of the original event the fact that some of the shots in the film show attractive naked women does not add any quality to it the movie gets worse and worse with every minute and does not even meet the requirements of so bad its actually good category if you really are into fantasdy and want to learn something about wiedzmin read the books instead
