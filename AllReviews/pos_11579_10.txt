POS a friend of mine asked doesnt one have to be proeuthanasia in order to like this movie is it a mistake of the movie to infer most quadriplegics want to end their lives interesting questionsbr br as far as i can see correct me if im wrong there is only one quadriplegic who wanted to end his life in the sea inside think ramn sampedro addressed this in the movie as well it is he who wants to die it is he who is fighting for his right to decide his death he is speaking for himself and not other quadriplegics though his pioneering work depending on ones perspective may prove beneficial or damaging to quadriplegics down the road his primary objective is a personal one but one thing this movie does my opinion anyway is that it forces us the viewers to ask ourselves the inferring questions my friend so succinctly put forthbr br after my first viewing of the sea inside i walked home in a conflicted blur i struggled to reconcile with this exasperating notion why would ramn want to die given the love care and sacrifices so unconditionally showered on ramn by the people surrounding him why would he doggedly cling on to his hurtful decision then on my second viewing a shared thought between ramn and the lawyer lady entered my consciousness it threw up a telling observation total dependency comes at the expense of intimacy most human beings crave for such an intimacy of course how much we value such needs depends largely on the individualbr br as a person with a familialbiased sensibility i empathised strongly with the caregivers in this movie why cant javier consider the sacrifice and the love from his family and friends is he blind to it all i would think not the miracle of the sea inside therefore is its insightful depiction of a very humanistic tug of war when we are faced with the guardianship of a sane but incapacitated loved one whom has expressed a calm conscious and rational intent to die what then is the right thing to do is caring for and keeping this loved one alive against his or her will a pious gesture does it show up the worth of our love or does it merely soothe our selfish fears of irreplaceable loss with so much understanding accorded to caregivers wouldnt their invalid charges by submitting themselves to the total dependency of others for survival also be an overlooked act of sacrifice rhetorical or not how much is dignity worth to an individual is living or dying with dignity a privilege or a right if we really care and love a person should we also respect their eventual decisions in life as in death a torrent of questions the movie might have asked answers to which im in no position to providebr br in our eagerness to intellectually demarcate the merits of prolife or prochoice we run the risk of ignoring a sea of grey thats engulfing the people most intimately affected the caregivers and the ones they care for the sea inside hence attempted to present the delicate yet complex relationship dynamics between them intuitively this film understands one thing that the nature of sacrifice is never onesided in this tug of war we should endeavour not to win arguments but to intently observe and hopefully determine who is the stronger party to make that sacrificebr br the sea inside is a sobering film it opened my eyes to things i dont wanna see and for that i am grateful
