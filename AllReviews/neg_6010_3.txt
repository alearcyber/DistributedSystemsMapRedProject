NEG for producer david o selznick no one director would ever do hence on a farewell to arms  we get two  charles vidor and john huston though both men were quite accomplished in their own right neither could make head or tail of this disastrous remake of hemmingways magnum opus hemmingway in general has never translated well from book to screen but under selznicks zeal to transform it into his next gone with the wind the excursion is both punishing and exhaustive at this point in selznicks career he was no longer the titan who could take box office poison and transform it into gone with the wind tired frail minus his studio and with an impending sense that his second marriage to jennifer jones might have been a mistake selznick handed the creative reigns of this flick over to fox studios  but he kept enough of himself in it to become a damn nuisance on the setbr br by now one is or should be familiar with the bittersweet tragic love story of a nurse catharine barkley jennifer jones and her soldier hero lt frederick henry rock hudson their passion is supposed to serve as the stabilizing force for what is essentially a war correspondents tale with romanticism thrown in for good measure but the chemistry between hudson and jones is both turgid and dull in the final reel jones facial contortions during child birth are so bad i am surprised that neither director opted to cut them from the general release part of the problem with jones is that at thirtyeight shes far too wise to play the optimistic catharine with any great conviction yet older actresses have frequently managed to make an audience forget discrepancies in age not so with jones one is painfully aware that she doesnt fit the bill in either acting chops or years invested on this planet hudsons laconic charm is hopelessly out of touch with to stoicism of an army soldier whose heart is broken but head remains strong the supporting cast is peppered with such luminaries as vittorio de sica and mercedes mccambridge but these are wasted bits of nonsense that in no way reflect upon the formidable talents of either actor and best made evident elsewhere in their canons of film makingbr br the anamorphic picture element for a farewell to arms looks good enough though theres just a bit too much film grain present in certain scenes for this reviewers liking overall colors are subtle and muted though balanced in accordance with the deluxe color processing employed at this time some fading is evident flesh tones dont appear very natural contrast levels are a tad weak blacks are generally solid whites are almost clean theres not much to recommend this film sonically its essentially a wordy picture with gun shots as a backdrop there are no extras
