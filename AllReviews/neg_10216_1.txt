NEG i really should give this stinker more credit that  star because the film has so many eyerolling lines that its almost worth the price of the rental br br the acting if you want to call it that is so stilted and contrived that it makes ed woods actors appear life like sammy the lone black character must be mimis husband in real life because he appears in her other films but he has zero acting ability his lines are priceless due to his absurd delivery though i suspect the intention was to create a sympathetic character his old man make up in her other turkey pushed to the limit is nobudget junior high school quality with cotton ball eyebrows and white spray painted hairbr br i cannot fathom anyone actually buying this video unless people like to throw their own mystery science theater parties and need a copy of something like this on hand it really is beyond fear its actually beyond funny
