NEG i wanted to like this one  the situation was rich and the setting unusual and interesting but the story is swamped with childish female gothic romance elements that are hard to swallow the director is unfairly prejudiced against the goy characters  content to let them be grotesque cardboard caricatures  and inexplicably indulgent towards the homewrecking behavior of the heroine the potentially interesting power struggle between the inventor and the governess is not really dealt withbr br feminist film makers will get more credibility when they stop manipulating situations to throw all the sympathy to the heroine and start dealing honestly with issues this movie more closely resembles the  pieces of gold another earnest failure more than the piano  a real tale of passion
