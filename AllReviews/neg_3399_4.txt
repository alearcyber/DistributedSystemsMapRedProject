NEG this is just a long advertisement for the movie the death tunnel although it is an interesting history of the waverly hills sanatorium the whole ghost theory is up to your interpretation more ghost orbs which you can duplicate with dust in front of a flash camera and the ectoplasmic mist is just someones cigarette smoke lit up with the camera flash i couldnt see any shadow people until they drew an outline around the blurry distortion of the image no scientific explanations were suggested for the phenomena only paranormal perhaps these are only events one would have to see to believe so be sure to make plans to visit the sanatorium on your next vacation in louisville kentucky
