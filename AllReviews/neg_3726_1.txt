NEG a waste of time talent and shelf space this is a truly abysmal film what are big leaguers like keanu reeves cameron diaz and dan aykroyd wasting their time being in such rubbish petty criminal reeves turns up to his brothers vincent donofrio wedding and ends up leaving with the bride a comedy thriller romance i honestly do not know reeves is wooden in the lead and casting dan aykroyd as a cop is so dreadful it has to be seen to be believed only bright spot from a dark dark tunnel is diaz and even she isnt that good rent out something else everyone involved with this mess should hold there heads in utter shame and prey that it gets lost in oblivion in the years to come
