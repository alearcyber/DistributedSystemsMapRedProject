POS this was a great showi dont remember much about about it but remember watching it and loving it i remember the mother and the father i really like the grandmother she was like a grandmother you really couldnt appreciate until you became an adult she was very knowledgeable and no nonsense my favorite song on the show was sardines in the morning that might not be the title i remember after seeing that show and hearing that song that i went to cleveland ohio to visit my cousins and me and my sister sang that song so much that by the time we left all of my little cousins were singing it too i too would love to find this on dvd
