POS hey what do you expect form a very low budget movie although i havent seen dahmer  i can say that following what the media put out about jeff this is a pretty accurate depiction i have studied the jeffrey dahmer case and learned all i can about this man this is a low budget movie but it shows the mentality of a serial killer if you can get past gore and see what the underlying story of a sick mind i loved this movie just brace yourself for low budget and no blood its a story as seen through the eyes of a killer and his actions and thoughts from childhood up through his arrest my favorite line is  if they had bothered to look in the back seat it might have saved a lot of lives enjoy
