NEG this film is a mediocre lowbudget flick ive seen much worse on mstk let me assure you but this is still a pretty crappy filmbr br the film is about clonus a topsecret government facility in which clones are used to give organs to politicians its an almost orwellian society actually almost but not quite effectivebr br the film starts to roll downhill when the head clone tim connely of emergency fame falls in love with a female clone paulette breen who appeared in this and at most four other films and this was not her first film they begin to suspect something after finding a beer can in the nearby river the plot starts to unravel the clone receives no answers from either the head scientist dick sargent from bewitched or the confessional a computer which supposedly knows everything so he breaks into the main clonus building and in a scene hilariously destroyed by mike and the bots finds out the truth including a clone video which eerily shows the exact same method that was used to clone dolly five years ago   and this film was made over twenty years ago    about clonus he breaks free pursued by two guards he has one hell of a time breaking through the twofoot high fences though he has a considerably harder time climbing up some boulders from there it continues to slide also appearing are peter graves beginning of the end it conquered the world as the presidential candidate and keenan wynn dr strangelove piranha once upon a time in the west and lurleen tuttle ma barkers killer brood psycho as the elderly couple who help clony after he escapesbr br the mstk version was priceless one of the best episodes everbr br four stars for the film for the mstk version
