NEG this movie must have looked when it was being pitched at development stage and getting a redgrave and a jacobi on board must have excited the money men all i can say is that they clearly did not have anything on that week jacobi camps it up in the way that only jacobi can do and i thought that he seemed to more of the actor that he parodied in his cameo role in frasier a few years back vinnie jones is not exactly bad he is just clearly out of his depth as a leading man he is really quite amiable throughout and if this was a pilot for a tv series it may have just got picked up however the scipt and the camera work were appalling quite why this jounalist and a press officer from the met would ever work together is never explained it certainly cannot have been because of the sexual chemistry of which there is none there is nothing wrong with a ridiculous and far fetched plot that you can pass off as original but the whole thing is just so contrived that the two stories just do not make sense at all it was like two stories confusingly edited in to one just to make up two hours go watch some paint dry for a couple of hours you life will be more fulfilled than watching this rubbish
