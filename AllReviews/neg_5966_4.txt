NEG i really liked this movie number  the star robot of the movie gets hit by lightning and some thing happened to his circuits he act and thinks more like a humanthe robot repeats commercials he learns after watching tv he then applies these sayings to his circumstances number  is quick witted and funny the character imitates voices of stars tries to dance like john travolta in staying alive and a lot of other things he has a saying for most of his circumstances that he memorized the actions of the robots is really good number  wants to drive cook and please stefany with all the characteristics of a human the way the robots move and line up is really hystericali am disappointed that the writers could not keep this clean for all viewers this movie has a surpris ending something you would not expect i hate movies that have swearing in them even though i like them i give them a lower rating this movie had swearing words jesus christ was used as swearing word which offends me it is used a least  times gd dm bull sht etc it could have been a wonderful movie with out all this offensive language there is no sex in this film some violence like robots blowing up cars and machines
