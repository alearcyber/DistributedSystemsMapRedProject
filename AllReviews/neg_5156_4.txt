NEG this movie features roaches as super flesh eating killers this may have been the first movie where roaches were the primary killers though not the first movie where roaches are killers damnation alley featured a scene with killer cockroaches and creepshow had a story that had them in this one they are the star not as good as it could have been this one doesnt have all that many kills in them i could be wrong on that point however because i have not seen this one in quite some time the roaches have gone killer and this very strange research lady is in town to study them yes she is quite strange as at one point she has her hand in a box on the killer roaches and she is like they are biting my hand and she says this in almost a state of ecstasy there is also one super big roach near the end of this one like in so many insect films not a great movie but worth checking out on a night you are bored out of your mind
