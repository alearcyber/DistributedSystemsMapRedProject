NEG this movie actually almost made me crybr br for starters the fake teeth then you spot a nice plastic or drawn set to make it even more boring all the action is followed by a bright light flash then the talking sound levels are so different sometimes too hard then too soft never exactly good like in good movies also it echoes so much that i think they had one microphone on the entire set and to make matters worse ever heard of stereo if the camera switches the sound always stays centered the actors talk like they are reading from a board staged behind the camera and the zooming into another scene how terrible childishbr br the music is so badly chosen that it never adds something it only destroys any accidentally created excitementbr br to finish it up the fighting scenes my  year old niece would make a better fighting scenebr br this movie is not even good for a laugh its just that bad
