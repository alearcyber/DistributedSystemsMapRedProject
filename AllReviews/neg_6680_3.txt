NEG i got interested in this movie because somebody had made a beautiful video for bjrks bachelorette with clips from it so i watched the movie and it is indeed stuningly beautiful a masterpiece of animationbr br unfortunately the story doesnt keep up it starts out well with interesting plotlines about people fencing for the possession of the rose bride but suddenly elevators fill up with water and looses their walls people float away and finally for no reason whatsoever utena is tranformed into a car and a highspeed chase ensuesbr br i like much anime for its ability to make alternative universes but this universe is just stupid if you are gonna watch this movie turn of the sound its better that way
