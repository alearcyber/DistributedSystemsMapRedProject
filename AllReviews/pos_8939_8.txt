POS its been a long time since such an original quite funny black comedy has surfaced if eating raoul is on your top  list do yourself a favor and find undertaking betty immediately the subject of death being funny has been attempted before see paul bartel and mary woronov in mortuary academy while that movie has some brilliant moments of black comedy undertaking betty is much more steady with a better cast who could imagine that the undertaking business might be fertile ground for an original uplifting and heartfelt comedy i was surprised and you will be too i highly recommend seeing undertaking betty  merk
