POS daniel percivals dirty war a bbc production made for television was shown recently on cable the film has a documentary style in the way it goes after the people that caused the near holocaust in one of the big metropolis of the world london in fact this film produced in  is almost a cautionary tale of the events of the following year in which terrorists set explosive devices in the public transport that killed innocent people that were in the wrong place at the wrong timebr br the film impresses for the pace the director and the production team gave to the project there are no dull moments in the movie as we watch the preparation by the terrorists and the people that are following their dirty work although the inevitable happens its amazing just to think what would be the consequences if a real dirty bomb was planted in such a densely populated areabr br the last images of the film have a chilling effect the mob scenes and the way the whole area is contaminated send shivers of fear thinking how it could possible happen anywhere
