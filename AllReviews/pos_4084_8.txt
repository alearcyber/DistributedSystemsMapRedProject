POS i thought the movie was good but i like to read the real story behind the based on a true story movies does anyone know the names and locations of the real characters the movie is based on i have done a complete internet search and cannot find any information on this case all i get is the movie information and the fact that it is based on a true story i find it hard to believe that a judge would change his sentence rendered immediately in the courtroom even after such a heartfelt speech by the brother gorgeous john corbett but overall the story was very gripping anyway if anyone knows the real real story i would appreciate you sharing it
