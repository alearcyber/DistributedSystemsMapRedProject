POS tipping the velvet has just three weeks ago been released in the uk and already i watch as countless letters flood to the national papers and tv guides claiming that it possesses a thin plot weak performances and an even weaker scriptbr br you find me incensed this is heresybr br i would really like to dispel all doubt by first congratulating andrew davies on enabling geoffrey sax to create this wonderful dramatization of sarah waters novel by cushioning him with such a fantastic script kudos but i fear i must now change tackbr br i saw one of the premiere tv guides here in the uk which shall remain nameless relentlessly describing tipping the velvet as a lesbian love story if they are and i assume they are trying to promote interest in the film then this is completely the wrong way to go about it aside from the phrase being a disappointingly inaccurate description by saying such a thing they are either a turning away those who would instinctively be repelled by that subject matter or b attracting a class of people who will only watch to see some serious girlongirl action buy a video through this display of serious inconsideration this and other magazines are cheapening what is a brilliant adaptation of one of recent literatures greatest works tipping the velvet is a story of love of passion of moving on of loss and of heartbreak its not a lesbian love story no sireebr br the end result is a stylish affair with excellent performances all round particularly from stirling hawes chancellor and may directionwise its intoxicating and immersive  sometimes fastpaced sometimes not  but it never ceases to be anything less than compelling as a whole its polished and well delivered the sex is undertaken with tenderness and delicacy  and although many will not class it as a real film it will remain among my favourites for some time to come
