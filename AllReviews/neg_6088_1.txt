NEG first off i just watched a movie on showtime called survival island it says it was a  movie with billy zane and since i like him and couldnt sleep i thought i would check it out looked interesting watched it and decided to look up on the imdb who was this new face juan pablo di pace and omg i could not believe it this movie has been renamed three and will be a new movie it is playing again in  hr and  mins on showtime channel again and this date is may  and edt or florida time you can check your showtime listings by title and see it i wont get into details so you can see the movie but at one point there is a lady in a white bikini that goes into the water taking it all off you see her naked body when she runs back out of the water you see her bottoms on funny there are a lot of other mess ups too i cant believe by coincidence i decided to look up this movie go figure wonder if the people renaming it sold it to some movie studio to put out but it is already playing on showtime ha ha good laugh i give it  stars c d movie
