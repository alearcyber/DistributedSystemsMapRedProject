NEG mickey rourke  who was once a famous movie star  plays martin fallon an ira terrorist who accidentally blows up a school bus full of children who is so disgusted by his actions decides to leave the ira and goes on the run in london br br  mild spoilers br br the movies opening is rather disturbing as the lives of little children are ended in a fireball  things like this happened throughout the s and s and into the s in northern ireland which gives a prayer for the dying a stark realism  however as soon as fallon decides hes going to give up violence  what  hes a terrorist and hes never blown up innocent passerbys before   realism disappears and clichs and ridiculous plot twists take place  martin is employed by the london underworld  dont they have their own hit men  to commit a hit while he wears an ira  uniform   never knew the provos wore uniforms  at a cemetery in broad daylight  wouldnt an ira man use a bomb placed under a car   where hes spotted by a priest who recognises him while he was in the sas  hands up who thinks im lying  im not and were half way through the running time and theres still several clichs to come br br this all sounds very silly and it is but what do you expect from a novel by jack higgins  everything is clichd  contrived and stereotypical and the bits that arent are just plain bizarre  the critics slaughtered this movie when it came out  most notably they stated that it might have some potential if the movie had bob hoskins playing gangster jack meehan and alan bates playing the sas soldier turned priest and for once the critics would have been right  they should also noted the film might have been less dire if fallon was played by someone who was capable of doing an irish accent  rourke might be hunky and macho  oh gawd another movie with an ira uberhunk  but accents arent his strong point any more than character acting is  to give you an idea how disappointing prayer for the dying is the director ended up disowning it which is always a bad sign br br as a footnote the original release of prayer for the dying in britain was delayed for several months because of  the enniskillen bombing   in november  the provisional ira exploded a bomb in the centre of enniskillen where a remembrance day parade which commemorates britains war dead was being held  eleven    people were killed and scores more injured  it wasnt an accident and no one left the ira because of it
