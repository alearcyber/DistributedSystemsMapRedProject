NEG being an admitted chess addict i was excited to see a documentary about the  rematch between garry kasparov and ibms deep blue supercomputer i was hoping to see an in depth look at the match and a lot of what kasparov had to say boy was i wrong and misguided by a mile this documentary is a lot like many modern documentaries  there is a lot of flash but no real substance after watching it i am sad to say i felt like i wasted my time one of the most annoying aspects about the documentary is that it does not stay at one place for a decent period of time it has the typical mtv type editing where the camera shows different images and quick sound bites from people every five seconds it is very sad that filmmaking has been watered down to the attention span of a year old childbr br i understand it is difficult to make a film about chess but that does not mean one should make it flashy game over did have a couple of interesting ideas though it brought up the idea whether computers can think like human beings or not whether computers have advanced to a unique new level this is what kasparov thought after the match but this film does not go deep enough with this idea also this film tries to bring in a bizarre theory it tries to imply the paranoid that a human being was making the moves along with the help of the computer kasparov had suspicions about this but still to this day there is no evidence towards the end of the film it tries to imply the bizarre that maybe anatoly karpov might have been the human being who was secretly making the moves with the aid of deep blue interesting to think about but i dont know how plausible or realistic it is i still would not recommend this movie though not even for chess addicts
