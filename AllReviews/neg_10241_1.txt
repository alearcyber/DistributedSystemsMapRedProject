NEG if ever there was a film that can be considered a missed opportunity then that film is galaxina what could possibly be wrong in basing a scifi film around a sexy statuesque female android surely such a film could never be a complete waste of time well sadly this movie is pretty close to useless there are a number of faults with this production it has to be said however there are two basic problems that entirely destroy the whole enterprise firstly this is a comedy with no funny bits at all or at the very least a film where the potentially amusing aspects are presented in an incredibly unamusing way secondly the title character is woefully underused this may be because dorothy stratten was not really an actress but if so it was a terrible decision as she is still easily the best thing about the film i dont think she really needed to be a great thespian to pull off the role of a sexy android to be perfectly honest anyway what we are left with is a whole lot of mindnumbing comedy relief which often is made up of hopeless spooftype gags of the big scifi hits of the time such as alien star wars and  its badly written and not funny at all and it doesnt even really have a plot to propel things along the story basically is about a police spacecruiser that is sent to get a rock thats it steven spielberg once said that a highconcept movie was one whose plot line could be described in one sentence what he didnt define was what you call a movie that can be described in less than a sentence  pointless maybebr br this seemed like a surefire winner to me but it failed miserably it seems to have been an attempt to spoof star wars and combine it with adult comedy situations all it does actually achieve is to leave you cold and a little irritated that it wasnt close to what it shouldve been a barbarella for the s this aintbr br shortly after this film was finished dorothy stratten was murdered in an appallingly violent and horrific way and for that reason galaxina has derived a considerable amount of its cult interest i just think its a great shame that dorothy didnt have a better film left to immortalise her
