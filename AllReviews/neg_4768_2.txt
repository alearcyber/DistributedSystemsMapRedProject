NEG ive watched a number of wixel pixel and sub rosa extreme movies lately and have found a lot to like about thembr br this sre movie seemed a lot more slight than all the others ive seen perhaps thats because this is a comedyhorror movie rather than straight horror and perhaps its also because the humor didnt register with me very wellbr br its a little less than seventy minutes long and the credits begin as the last ten minutes are beginning there are some outtakes goofs and behind the scenes stuff going on while those credits rollbr br sre movies do tend to be short and tend to feel padded out in spite of that this is no exception with some scenes that tend to go on too longbr br the story involves a poor kid in christmastown california whod been picked on by all his classmates hed had one shoe stolen and unable to replace it he was dubbed oneshoe mcgroo due to an obsession with pirates his parents gave him an eyepatch for christmas with a christmas tree emblazoned on the eyepatchbr br many of the classmates are killed and the few who remain gather together to decide what to do theyre picked off one by one by mcgroo who stalks around to the sound of sleigh bells ringingbr br the characters are pretty much all broad stereotypes like the nerd named dorkus etc theres an odd scene in which a kinky couple has sex the woman is handcuffed and blindfolded the man wears a large paper watermelon slice over his head this reminded me of some of the stranger sex scenes from director rinse dreambr br the picture quality is good and there are a lot of extras but basically a pretty silly moviebr br oh well i guess you can never have too many christmas horror movies still there are a lot of other needy holidays
