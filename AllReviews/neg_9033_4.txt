NEG so seagal plays a dea detective named john hatcher who lost his partner on a drug investigation into surprise surprise colombia not to brag or anything but my father was born and raised in colombia hence my last name and now hes a doctor in california so no matter what the movies would have you believe there are some things other than drug dealers and cocaine that come out of colombiabr br at any rate in a drug bust gone bad hatcher loses his partner and accidentally kills a naked colombian prostitute inspiring him to go to confession somewhere that i have never seen him go before in any of his movies before or since it was actually pretty interesting seagal has a tendency to come off as almost asexual the way he never gets much involved with women other than as a plot device and the way the occasional seduction attempt whether by a stripper or by a lover never piques the slightest bit of interest from him hes all getthe badguys all the time br br but in the confession booth he confesses to having lied sold drugs falsified evidence and even slept with informants in order to get the information he needed to put the bad guys behind bars i hope im not getting in trouble with god by telling you this the priest tells him to go to his family so he decides its time to retire from the force br br the next third of the movie is an exercise in the paperthin characterization characteristic of seagals films marked for death is the story of seagal against a band of mystic jamaican drug dealers and these guys have no discretions about pushing their products in broad daylightbr br hatcher goes back to visit his old high school coach max a minimal effort by keith david and right in the middle of practice there are some of these dreadlocked crackheads sitting right there in the bleachers peddling crack to some bookwormlooking high school girlsbr br maybe i just had a sheltered experience in high school but i didnt know crack dealers and crackheads hung out at school in the middle of the day at any rate its not long before hatcher learns how evil these guys are theyre not just peddling crack to high school kids but the coach has been losing football players regularly to their drugs they engage in smartass staredowns with max and since thats not enough his yearold niece died in their crackhousebr br ah ok we get the picture im sure they also torture puppies and beat up old women and maybe steal candy from children too just for good measure is it really this hard to establish who the bad guys are yearold niece died in their crackhouse wowbr br anyway not only does the movie not know how to develop villains without resorting to what basically boils down to movie namecalling where evil deeds are shallowly assigned to them through dialogue but they also dont know how they should act br br the leader of the drug dealers is named screwface and i suppose that alone should tell you something about the kind of movie this is screwface is a cartoonish jamaican man with these bright bizarrely green eyes which i am guess must be an important part of his character because he spends a good majority of his screen time with his eyes half bulging out of his head his favorite means of intimidation is to scream really loud in his wildly overblown jamaican accent with his face quite literally less than an inch away from whoever hes yelling at this guy likes to get so into guys faces that he has to turn his head to the side so their noses dont touch all i could think about was how the poor guys would deal with his breathbr br man they do not want you to forget that these guys are jamaican by the way their accents are so exaggerated and overblown that for most of the movie its nearly impossible to understand them not that it matters it doesnt matter what theyre saying all you need to know is that everything that comes out of their mouths is some kind of evil drugrelated thing theyre just the psychos that peddle drugs and kill people the movie must have been a huge hit in jamaicabr br my biggest problem with the movie is that the theatrics particularly of the bad guys as ive described are spectacularly goofy even for a seagal film they are so cartoonish and weird that its impossible to take them as anything other than a goofball bmovie creation something slapped together to provide fodder to whom seagal can distribute his characteristic brand of smackdown retribution br br but there is also a bizarre kind of mysticism in the movie that just makes it all come off as weird for example a mystic i guess you would call her at one point puts some kind of curse on screwface by if i remember correctly spitting mouthfuls of bacardi onto a live rooster thats hanging upside down before beheading it and dripping its blood onto a picture of screwface hmm interesting br br sadly its this same woman that warns hatcher that his family has been marked for death by these people meaning theyve got some voodoo hex on them not to belittle anyone but if i was told that my family had been cursed by people like that i would just laugh at it hatcher doesnt strike me as the kind of guy to take much stock in freaky voodoo curses br br but the setup as you can see is pretty standard for a seagal film unique villains i guess you could say although not very impressive definitely the weirdest film of seagals early career
