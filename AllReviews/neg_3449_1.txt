NEG im glad i never watched this show when it came outbr br i just wondered why it lasted  years it reminds me of the terrible s with fake people fake clothes and fake music how did i ever survive growing up in this era br br the acting in the majority of episodes i have watched are forced this makes for very boring shows the plot lines are not very interesting as the old twilight zone shows the old show inspired the imagination and made one look forward to the next show br br stick with the old twilight zone shows and spare yourself the pain of watching garbage
