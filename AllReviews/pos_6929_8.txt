POS i like dylan moran from his work in black books although i found some of his standup to be really indulgent in terms of long confused gaps however i was intrigued to see this film starring he and michael caine and curiosity got the better of mebr br i was stunnedbr br dylans vocal range and characterisation of the different people he was playing in the film was absolutely perfect something beyond the skills of a mere standup comedian and really truly on a par with alec guinness john hurt and the other greats truly he was skilled in his portrayalbr br michael caine was a very convincing prima donna and the standard british film device of having a precocious child on hand to be overly wise and withering worked the only aspect i didnt really like was the unbelieveable plot feature of the chemistry between dolores and the cockney gangstas hard man played by dylanbr br other than that it was greatbr br i also like the noncopout ending where it did end up happily ever after but with mc getting a beating ok its not exactly being strung up by your goolies and beijng disembowelled which is what a real crime boss would do to you if you nicked k off them but it showed at least a small measure of reality in the storybr br i liked the film and i would recommend it to anyone but i would also warn them not to turn it off after  minutes because it started a bit slow if you stick it out then it will all come backbr br and with regards to the swearing well theyre in ireland it wouldnt be real otherwise
