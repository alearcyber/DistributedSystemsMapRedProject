POS forget the overrated batman begins this is the ultimate batman movie that you are not gonna want to miss out on this movie has everything and it totally surpasses the first  mega hit it may not have done as well as the first one in at the box office but this is certainly a much better film the visuals are amazing burton works his magic as he always does in his films once again gotham city batmans hunting ground is an amazing sight to behold the story itself is actually quite good and the  villains in this one are very interesting much more interesting in fact then there comic book counterparts tim burton and screenplay writer daniel walters go a step further to bring you a truly emotional connection with these characters the penguin played to perfection by danny devito is a type of tragic character who was abandoned by his parents at birth and later in life seeks revenge on the world that denied him very disgusting to watch at times but he has some of the most classic lines a villain could ever utter in a single film the other villain is catwoman played so absolutely brilliantly by michelle pfieffer one of the most beautiful actresses of our time and gives a wow performance and totally steals the show as far any of the past and present live action batman villains is concerned she also has a tragic background her name is selina kyle and she is a very putupon mousy secretary for a shrewd business man called max shreck who later murders her by shoving her out a window somehow she survives and is awakened by cats and decides right then and there to become the legendary catwoman not before of course the amazing sequence in which she completely lets loose and wrecks her entire apartment in one of the most oscar worthy performances of rage and anger i have ever seen in an actressbr br michael keaton once again dons the cape and cowl as batman and also as bruce wayne and this time hes much darker theres not much else to say here except that keaton is simply the best actor to play batman ever he just oozes cool and he has a kind of clint eastwood approach to playing batman and he is very dark he doesnt talk a lot and when he does he sounds very cool and he doesnt make his voice sound all goofy and fake ie bales batman voice in batman begins he struts around gotham like a man possessed by his own inner demons hes pshycologically disturbed and you know it in this outing he takes on  of the most famous baddies to ever grace the batman comic book worldbr br i have to say though despite the awesomeness of the action scenes like the scenes with the coolest batmobile ever racing down the street knocking thugs to the ground and batman gliding across gotham its the romantic angle between pfieffer and keaton that really makes this movie classic a top choice for anyone who wants to see the real batman in action i rate this a  would give it more if i could
