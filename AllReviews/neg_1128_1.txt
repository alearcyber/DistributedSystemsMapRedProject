NEG this has got to be the worst piece of crap i have ever seen randy quaid funny as a supporting actor in the original but not as the leading too much eddie the original is a classic like the original the supporting actor carried the show ed asner was very funny he is the eddie of christmas vaction  how come snots still looks the same after all those years and everyone else in the original looks  years older after  minutes of watching this movie i dont believe i had even laughed yet the island thing just didnt work if it wasnt for the good looking south pacific female guide on the island the movie would have been a total loss i sat on this review for a week and yes i still think the movie should never have been made lets hope there is not a thirdbr br shawn gearin
