NEG eric idle robbie coltraine janet suzman  it should have been almost impossible to go wrong of course it has some funny moments  the scene in the showers when robbie coltraine echoes lon chaney jrs ghastly werewolf line i cant help myself is hilarious but ultimately the plot script and direction are flat as a pancake and as tired as a  year old nun after  hail marys when i was a child carry on films filled this niche slightly better which is a really sad indictment of a film with such a promising cast
