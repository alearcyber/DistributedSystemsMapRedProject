NEG this vicious little film is horrendous my low rating for it comes for two main reasons the first is that it is an animal snuff film and i find that whole concept so vile it turns my stomach filmed over a hundred years ago i can only hope that weve evolved into something a little more humane and compassionate this film is complete and utter exploitation made to cash in on the sensational aspects of the film and the subject historical interest aside this is something to watch only if one finds themselves in the grip of morbid fascinationbr br reason number two look at the way that the camera is set up it is placed in the best possible location to fully capture the full effect long march forward of the elephant perfect view of the electrocution platform and a cold and clinically dispassionate viewpoint of the elephant with smoke coming out of it before it finally collapses sickeningbr br thomas edison did many great things for civilization and his talents and intelligence arent in doubt nobody is perfect but when you realize that this film provided a an opportunity for him to trump early cinematic competitors with a sensationalist film of an elephant being electrocuted and b he filmed the execution to demonstrate the greater effectiveness of dc as opposed to ac you cant help but wonder if the scientist in him was a little too dispassionate and cold any number of peter cushings mad scientists would be proud the rest of us should be ashamed and revolted
