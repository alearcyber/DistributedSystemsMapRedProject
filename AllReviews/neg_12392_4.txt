NEG grosse pointe blank was really quite a below average film its hit man theme is very dry and is more like a romantic comedy than a hit man thriller the acting is very normal the performances are extremely embarrassing at times with many characters seeming very eccentric and that really annoyed me the whole reunion and the wow i havent seen you in  years element is extremely cheesy and many scenes just drag on especially nearer the end when they are at the actual reunion party and the characters are going through each of their former classmates one by one greeting them it just all seemed very tacky pointless and was poorly executed br br dan akroyds role as a rival assassin is very sparse he only seems to appear once at the very beginning and right at the very end in a final show down which is hugely hyped up but doesnt deliver at allbr br the soundtrack is also very mediocre the bulk of the songs that are in this film are straight out of the s and with the exception of two or three are very bad hearing duff songs over quite a duff film just adds to the negativity that surrounds this filmbr br i could go on and on about how little things were annoying and were just very bad such as the very few action sequences that came and went very quickly the lack of character development and how poorly the whole thing was constructed in that department the way that half the time you forget that cusaks character is even a hit man at all as the element is so nonexistentbr br even the way the comedy thinks its funny but it isnt i didnt laugh once during this movie sure maybe i smirked now and again but my only real feel good point was when i realised the movie was nearly overbr br please dont waste your time with grosse pointe blank despite the relatively high but badly incorrect imdb rating ive seen films that are better than this film that have lower rating on this site which tells you that there are better films out there just dont bother with this one
