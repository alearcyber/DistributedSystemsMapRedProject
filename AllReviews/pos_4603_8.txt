POS a good x evil film with tastes of james bond romeo and juliet and maybe even star warsbr br the evil count von bruno receives an english gentleman as a guest for a very dangerous hunt elga the beautiful simple and well intentioned lady that was forced to marry the count provides the love triangle the count missing eye points to a terrible past the englishman is not what the count thinks and is a terrible treat to him there is also the terrible hunchback crocodiles and even the side appearance of some torture instrumentsbr br boris karlloff here in a support role makes an strong but somewhat stiff presence the other actors and direction are the symbol of an era the strong representations of black and white movies since the beginning there is no doubt of who is the evil guy who is the good one even traitors and stiffs can be identified somewhat easily
