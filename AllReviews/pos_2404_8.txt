POS i like this movie cause it has a good approach of buddhism for example the way buddhist use to care all kind of living things combining some fancy and real situations in some parts the photography is very good and a lot of messages about freedom as the hawk episode staying always focused in every moment even in tough situations it has also funny situations as swanks birthday and talking this two times academy awards her acting show us how the people who use to live in this kind of culture is trying to have a resistance behavior when miyagi is taking her to a buddhist temple and how she slowly is changing her mind and of course pat morita has been always great
