NEG how does a movie become a biblical epic simply by quoting a couple of scriptures  using some names out of the bible for your characters the only thing that was biblical about this epic was the names of the characters oh i almost forgot the  kingdoms israel egypt  sheba were also used where did king vidor get the rest of his story from it surely wasnt from the bible it was complete  utter nonsense if you want to read about solomons reign as king in israel then read  kings    chronicles  you will even come across adonijah in  kings    the queen of sheba who doesnt show up until king solomon has been king for about  years or so which by the way is long after adonijah  joab had been dead can be found in  kings    chronicles  one of the first thing solomon does is make an affinity with pharoah by taking his daughterbr br yes king solomon did get involved with the worshipping of false gods  this is why the kingdom was split after his death not the temple being destroyed by lightning also i think solomon was too busy marrying  providing temples to the false gods of his  wives  tending to his  concubines to be fighting egypt let alone a dead brotherbr br like i said this movie was utter nonsense if you arent gonna use the story in the bible then call it something else this couldve just as easily been called romeo  juliet or sid  nancybr br
