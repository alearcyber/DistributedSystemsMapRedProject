NEG the time machine starts in new york during  where professor alexander hartdegen guy pearce proposes to his beloved girlfriend emma sienna guillory who accepts unfortunately just after they are attacked by a mugger  emma is shot dead  dies in alexanders arms jump forward four years later  alexander has built a time machine which he uses to travel back to the night emma was killed in order to save her but she is still killed only a different way this time alexander realises whatever he does however many times he goes back emma will always end up dead one way or another  he yearns to know the answer why so he travels far into the future to discover the truth however after having destroyed the moon two new races have evolved on earth the human like eloi  the monstrous morlocks that eat the eloi alexander decides to stick around  save the eloibr br directed by simon wells who is actually the great grandson of author hg wells who wrote the original the time machine book on which the original the time machine  film was based  it is in fact the  film that producer john logans script is based upon here rather than wells original literally source while all three share the same basic story  ideas this remake adds the subplot about alexanders fianc emma being killed  thats the reason he invents a time machine rather than just because he is clever  he can the script is a mixture of scifi action adventure  drama none of which really grabbed me or engaged me that much sure there are a few pretty special effects a few nice action scenes  the moment when alexanders question is answered regarding why he cant save emma is actually quite intelligent  makes sense it never really captured my imagination  i was never really moved by it either the time travel aspects of the time machine feel very similar to terminator  judgment day  in the sense you cant change the past but at the same time the future is not set only the time machine isnt anywhere near as good a film as terminator  judgment day the characters are alright although i thought guy pearce just looked too young to be a brainy scientist capable of inventing a time machine  theres never any real explanation behind its mechanics either as its like one moment theres no time machine the next he has invented  made one  it works perfectly i reckon the back to the future trilogy offer far more thrills laughs excitement  general entertainment value than the time machine ever does  while i will stop short of calling it a bad film since it moves along at a decent pace tells a reasonable story  has its moments i wouldnt call it brilliant or even particularly good there is also a cheeky little reference to the book  original film which are both namechecked herebr br the benefit this modern version has over the original is the development of special effects  in particular cgi which leads to scenes of time rapidly passing around alexander in his time machine complete with huge buildings being built new ridges canyons  mountains being formed  a elaborate pan back which ends up in space as we see passenger rockets orbiting the moon the effects work is good there are one or two moments that look a little below par but generally speaking the effects are good i saw the time machine on telly  the station playing it badly pan and scanned it so the left  right edges of the frame were cut off the screen thus cutting off part of the year on alexanders time machine dial so i actually didnt know what year he went to apparently director gore verbinski took over the last eighteen days of filming as wells was suffering from extreme exhaustion while the imdb says that the time machine itself was the biggest  most expensive prop ever built for a film at that point which i find hard to believe  guy pearce broke a rib during a fight scene but like a trooper carried onbr br with a supposed budget of about  the production values are high with a lovingly recreated period new york  good effects work although amazingly the time machine was nominated for an oscar for best makeup but lost out to frida  the acting is mixed jermey irons puts in a good performance in a terrible makeup job that has him looking like a reject from a lord of the rings film while singer samantha mumba makes her big screen debut here  is simply terrible although guy pearce is quite good  fairly likablebr br the time machine isnt a particularly bad film or a particularly good one just a somewhat unremarkable one that is watchable  passes an hour and a half but not much else watch back to the future  again instead
