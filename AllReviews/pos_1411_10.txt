POS the theme song often goes through my head after all these years i was never much of a tv watcher probably because i was just entering my busy teen years when my family bought our first set in  and it never became part of my life but from the first episode of lawman i was hooked and it is the only tv show ive ever scheduled my week aroundbr br intelligent believable wellwritten and wellacted and john russell is still to me the most beautiful man i ever saw peter brown was no dog either o br br i agree that it is one of the most underrated tv series of all time i hope i can find some episodes for my grandchildren to watch
