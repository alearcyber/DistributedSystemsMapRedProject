POS shohei imamauras black rain was released in  just at the onset of the aids epidemic a fact that gives the film about the slow deterioration of hiroshima radiation victims an added poignancy the black rain in the title refers to the combination of ash radioactive fallout and water that fell one or two hours after the explosion there have been other books and films about the dropping of the atomic bomb but none as unique and powerful as this one based on a novel by masuji ibuse who gathered information from interviews and the diaries of reallife bomb victims the film depicts how an entire family is affected psychologically as well as physically by the bomb years after the original explosion it is a horrifying vision but one that resonates with deep compassion for humanity br br the film begins in hiroshima on august   as soldiers and civilians go about their normal daily activities suddenly a blinding light flashes and a thunderous blast is heard almost every single building is destroyed or damaged beyond repair the first atomic bomb ever dropped on a city is now a part of history survivors must somehow restart their lives unaware of the bombs devastating after effects filmed in highcontrast black and white the story centers around yasuko yoshiko tanaka a young woman who is caught in the radioactive rain as her boat heads back to the city to search for friends and relatives in hiroshima imamura shows us indelible images that remain with us a young boy with skin hanging from his body pleads with his brother to recognize him an older man is in tears over his inability to free his son from piles of debris a mother is in torment as she rocks the blackened body of her childbr br when the family returns to their rural home yasukos life is forever changed she sees her friends dying around her and waits for the inevitable bouts of radiation sickness that have already affected her uncle shigematsu shimuza kazuo kitamura and aunt shigeko shimuza etsuko ichihara pretending that there is only business as usual the family denies that the bomb has affected yasuko she forgot how hiroshima and nagasaki were destroyed everyone forgot it they forget the hell of fire and go to rallies like an annual festival im sick of it says a friend katayama akiji kobayashi yasuko internalizes the tragedy feeling shame for being different than others and guilty for being contaminatedbr br when her aunt and uncle try to find her a husband the eligible men refuse to marry her because of suspicions about her health even though shigematsu has copied her diary to prove that she wasnt directly exposed to the bomb the only suitor she feels comfortable with is another damaged man yuichi keisuke ishida who has a panic attack every time he hears the roar of an engine at the end the beauty of life shows itself ever so fleetingly when yasuko goes to the pond and sees a sight she has been longing for all her life the king carp jumping in the water playfully as if to say that beyond despair there is still joy sadly we hear on the radio statements by politicians about using the bomb once again in the korean war human beings learn nothing says shigematsu they strangle themselves unjust peace is better than a war of justice why cant they see immamuras black rain has hopefully allowed all of us to see more clearly
