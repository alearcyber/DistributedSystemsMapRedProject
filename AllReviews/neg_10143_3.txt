NEG does anyone else think that reba is basically a ripoff of roseanne just look at the characters from the two families connors roseanne and harts reba  the blonde bombshell elder daughter becky connor and cheyenne hart whos married to a moron mark healy and van montgomery the sarcastic brunette younger daughter darlene connor and kyra hart the little brother dj connor and jake hart and the quirky relative jackie connor and barbarajean booker hart br br and then of course there is the biggest similarity reba hart and roseanne connor reba tried to copy the sarcastic and toughlove style mom without giving her the same lovable qualities as roseanne had or perhaps they made her too lovable for reba hart seems to waver between being mean and scary hence vans line to his wife cheyenne im not afraid of you im afraid of your mother and being sweet and caring with little transition in between roseanne at least managed to get it across that she was being cruel to be kind since she was always mean and sarcastic and whenever she tried to open up it was hard for her as inconsistent as rebas character is its hard for her to be believable br br but even if the characters werent completely ripped off of roseanne nothing couldve saved the show from being subpar in the plot area the writers try to give the show substance but they really cant lay off the corny jokes long enough to give any impact and youd better believe the jokes are corny its as if they were written by a twelveyearold who thinks that any joke is hilarious while occasionally they come out with something thats funny i dont pretend that i didnt laugh at a few episodes these gems are too few and far between to make reba witty br br overall reba is a very mediocre show with obvious ripoffs of roseanne subpar plots and subsubpar humor and lets face it terrible acting the show might be a bit better actually if they replaced all the actors especially reba herself who is more community theater quality than primetime sitcom quality br br i give it a  out of  just to be fair to the good jokes that make it in
