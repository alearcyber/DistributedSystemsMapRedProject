NEG my first question is not about the horrible acting not about the horrendous writing it is the directing the choices that were made about the cinematography are some of this worst decisions i have ever seen why does every single bad guy have to die in slow motion i was about to beat myself with a rubber hose the camera shots make it so that you cant see whats going on i was just about to turn the movie off because of jalal merhis accent when it made it to the sex scene so i thought it might get better well it did not if you rate special effects on an abc rating scale i would have to put it around a w or so and did i mention the acting wow was it bad and the worst part of the entire expect to die experience is the blatant misuse of the phrase on the cover which is the matrix just got deadlier comparing this movie to the matrix is easily the worst comparison i have ever seen if you havent seen this movie dont unless you are looking for a good reason to beat your head against the wall
