NEG i bought this film at blockbuster for  because it sounded interesting a bit ranmaesque with the idea of someone dragging around a skeleton because there was a cute girl in a miniskirt on the back and because there was a restricted viewing sticker on it i thought it was going to be a sweet or at least sincere coming of age story with a weird indie edge i was  wrongbr br having watched it i have to wonder how it got the restricted sticker since there is hardly any foul language little violence and the closest thing to nudity honestly i dont usually go around hoping for it is when the girl is in her nightgown and you see her panties you see her panties a lot in this movie because no matter what shes wearing a miniskirt of some sort even the antireligious humor is tame and lame caricatured insincere derivative unoriginal and worst of all not funny in the slightestit would be better just to listen to ray stevens would jesus wear a rolex on his television show this would barely qualify as pg it is not rated but blockbuster refuses to let anyone under the age of  rent thisas if it was pornographic any little kid could go in there and rent the edited version of requiem for a dream but they insist that zack and reba is worsebr br it is but not in that waybr br in a way this worries methe only thing left that could offend people is the idea of the suicide at the beginning if anybody needs to see movies with honestly portrayed suicides not this one but better ones like the virgin suicides its teenagers if both of those movies were rated r purely because of the suicide aspect then i have little chance of turning a story ive been writing into a pg movie the main characters are eleven and a half and twelve suicide is one of the top three leading causes of death in teenagers i think its number  so chances are that most teens have been or will be affected by itbr br just say no to this movie though
