NEG im trying to understand what people liked about mirrormask i am an avid film viewer and hobbyist film maker as i was telling friends during my lunch hour mirrormask may well be my biggest movie disappointment of the year just like the short moongirl the film missed its marks several times during the movie it made attempts at humor it sets you up for the laugh instead of making you laugh it leaves you feeling empty the jokes reminded one of the recent star wars films they werent funny unless you were five and the acting felt similarly terrible ive seen actors actually act in front of a blue screen and ive believed it but not in this film not for a secondbr br this film takes a formula and tries to apply it with pretty artwork and though the script is totally workable and the special effects quite beautiful it has no heart to it and fails miserably i left the film shaking my head and considered leaving the theater i felt hallow and miserable and still havent gotten the sour taste out of my mouth from it i love independent film i encourage people to view independent films to support them but not this film this film shouldnt have been made at least not like this why did the director miss the marks so clearly they were clearly setup not just the humor but the emotions the drama even the lines were poorly timed and delivered it was like the film walked on three legs instead of four its steps are awkward and miss timed and it could fall over with the slightest push dont see this film i dont care who you are it isnt worth your time
