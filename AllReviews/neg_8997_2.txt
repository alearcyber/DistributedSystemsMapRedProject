NEG after reading the mostly glowing comments about this movie i decided to rent it despite some suspicions of tv movies i should have followed my instinctsbr br i tried so hard to warm up to the movie and find merit in it but i just couldnt the story never draws you in or rings true and the acting is perfunctory at best and laughable at worst everything in this production is amateurishbr br always a joy to watch mary mcdonnell may be the only performer to escape this disaster without damaging her career or reputation i wont even bother checking the name of the leading man  hopefully hes back doing commercialsbr br even poor vanessa redgrave whom i adore and respect seemed to be channeling katherine hepburn all the time appearing as if she were really drugged in the home maybe she needed the moneybr br if i can save one person from wasting  minutes on this tripe i will feel vindicated
