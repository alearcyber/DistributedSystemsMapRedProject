POS i missed the full four hour version when it was originally released in theaters because it played one week i had to settle for seeing the shorter two and a half hour version a year or so later and was left stunned by what i saw i left the theater thinking i had witnessed a masterpiece and wondering what the full version was likebr br the full version is mostly good but it has sequences that are so incredibly dull that the whole movie is pulled down and almost sinks beneath the wavesbr br the problem is entirely in the editing which should be labeled as the final word on excess there are times when things go on and on and on and nothing happens shots of people in a city that go on much too long with no purpose in the narrative we get beautiful vistas and visions of such beauty that they bring tears to your eyes but they are used too frequently as a place holder instead of as punctuation or to set a place much of the longer version seems to be on screen simply because it looked goodbr br ive attempted to actually sit down and watch heavens gate with out resorting to the fast forward button but somewhere along the way i find i cant stand it any morebr br i wish mgm would take pity on us and release the shorter version to dvd as well as the huge dinosaur perhaps as a two pack so that we could see which is the better version and whether cimino was mad or notbr br and while they were at it why not include the once rumored johnson county war edit that ran  minutes supposedly united artists tinkered with a further cut in the hopes of getting some of their money back whether it was ever done or still exists is up in the air but it would be interesting to see
