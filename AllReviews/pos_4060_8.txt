POS showtime is a mess but its an entertaining mess the plot is forgettable the satire is lightweight and the action sequences though wellstaged arent that exciting but i laughed a lot credit goes to the inspired pairing of de niro and murphy they have great chemistry murphy delivers the oneliners de niro cracks us up with a look or grimace this movie will get a rush hourlike reception from the critics dont listen to them if youre a fan of de niro or murphy youre going to enjoy this movie
