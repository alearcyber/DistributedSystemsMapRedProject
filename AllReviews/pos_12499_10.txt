POS i was plagued by nightmares involving sesame street and the muppet show during my childhood i loved the programs but when i slept id dream about muppets not unlike the ones on tvbut not quite the ones on tvbr br they would speak gibberish and laugh and sing while eating each other and killing each other theyd take a bite of their cute felt flesh and it would tear apart followed by arterial bleeding nice but that was the pasti love this show i saw peter jacksons meet the feebles years ago and wondered why there wasnt similar work out there well here it is as sick twisted and somehow socially potent the old hobbits visionbr br if you like this show and you havent seen meet the feebles get it on amazon or some such film source youre in for a treatbr br by the way clarence would totally kick triumphs dog ass
