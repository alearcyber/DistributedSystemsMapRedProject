POS especially when looking at the amount of crap that has made it to dvd i found this movie very funny rip torn is classic with his barbs rob schneider if hilariously annoying as the overcompensating ensign bruce dern makes a great villain the entire cast seems to be having a blast and its not at the expense of the audience if you like just plain fun comedy and arent looking too deeply into meaning you just might fall in love with this one
