POS good lord how this ended up in our dvd player ill never knowmy wife thought it was a new release shed missed somehownevermind its a couple of years old and in danish  i think she kept looking for the english soundtrackbr br all in allthe film wasnt bad good production valuesbetter performances and a clever story that doesnt get too far away from itself make for tidy darkhumored fare from across the sea the ending will make you chucklein fact the whole film will incredibly strange characters that we grow genuinely interested in make a film that might be worth your whilewithout spoiling the plot the films title and dvd jacket give you a good idea where this thing is going
