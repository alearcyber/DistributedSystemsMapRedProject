NEG the main character pharaon has suffered a loss of his wife and child in the prefilm past he deals with with by just shutting down emotionally too long a movie too much time spent on pharaons inexpressive face too much road time one of the banes of tv filling time with moving cars trains etc long scenes of him doing trivial  sometimes totally inexplicable nonsensically trivial  actions with neither reason or emotion his best friends joseph and domino are not much more their relationship based on sex this film perhaps gives new meaning to the phrase gratuitous sex domino and pharaons mother are the two characters who display some emotion but not much it is hard to tell with all the characters in this movie is it indifferent acting indifferent writing or simply indifferent characters portrayed by good writing and good acting characters in this film talk very little to anyone its little wonder their emotionally isolated which is all the more bizarre because its clear they live in a neighborhood where the people are friendly and know each other
