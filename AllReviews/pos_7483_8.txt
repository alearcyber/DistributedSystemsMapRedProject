POS thursday is clearly derivative of the new wave of crime films released since quentin tarantino took the genre by storm with reservoir dogs and pulp fiction in the early nineties but it has enough ideas of its own to ensure that it remains an interesting little film thursday utilises a few characters mostly within a single location it works because each character is quirky enough in their own right to be memorable and when put together what youve got is a very amusing little thriller there is little substance to be found within the plot but it doesnt matter because nobody goes into this sort of film expecting a lifeaffirming experience the plot follows casey a former drug dealer who has gone straight and is now living as a successful architect in suburbia with his wife the pair wants to adopt a child but things turn awry when casey receives a visit from his old partner in crime nick who brought with him a case of heroine and a load of money stolen from the cops thursday is going to turn out to be a very interesting day for our former criminalbr br the first scene sets the film up rather nicely and ensures that we know what to expect we see a coffee order go wrong which turns into a murder scene that the culprits promptly cover up when a cop comes in for refreshments the scene is soaked with dark humour and witty dialogues and that is carried on throughout the rest of the movie thursday is a very funny film and scenes such as the ones that see the adoption visitor turn up at an awkward time ensure that the film is difficult to dislike its true that the film doesnt bring anything new to the table cinematically or plotwise but the fact that its happy to wallow in its derision ensures that theres more time for the absurd situation to build around the central characters the acting is decent enough with the entire cast clearly having fun with this plot thomas jane holds the film together well in the lead role while amusing portrayals from james legros paulina porizkova michael jeter glenn plummer and mickey rourke back him up nicely this film is unlikely to impress the seasoned film fan but if you just want an amusing little movie with a few enjoyable twists and performances thursday is likely to suffice
