POS a brief history of time the cosmological content of this documentary is fascinating the thoughts provoking and the man brilliant yet i had a hard time enjoying this documentary br br the way the family members and professors are interviewed feels so unnatural these members were interviewed on specifically built sets and were directed uncomfortably mostly their accounts came across as very acted and forcefully directed the deliberate noninclusion of asked questions manipulates the given information into a very harsh and impersonal format br br i do not know who are responsibly for the interviewing but they did a dreadful job and with that took away from the viewing experiencebr br overall still a fascinating documentary well worth seeing if only for the interesting concepts presented
