NEG ive seen this programme a few times and the more a see of it the less i like it jamie lynn spears was approached to do this because of the fact that she is britneys sister and im sorry to say that that in the show is obvious theyve created the character zoey to be everything people want to believe jamie lynn is clever original smart pretty popular etc the characters around her are only there to make her look better by being smarter then them more popular than them more wanted by boys then them there is nothing original about this and its poured with money so every kid there has the coolest of fashions and stuff i also have to say for a  year old girl or however old she is cant be much older she wears very mature clothing those short skirts are too short it makes young people want to wear them and all that makeup this adds to the rising problems of why young girls get into so much trouble the only thing i will say is that the opening credits are sung by jamie lynn and given her age isnt bad at all much better than her sister anyway when it comes to vocal ability sorry its too mature and yet too dumbed down its poorly acted with predictable story lines and there is far too much stereotyping going on too
