NEG i realize its a small statistical sampling  votes as of this posting but  out of  im giving this movie a  and even thats generous ive tried to watch this movie three times now the saturday night  pm premiere on scifi channel and the saturday night at  am and thursday night rebroadcasts and ive fallen asleep all three times before the movie ends which leaves me with a laundry list of unanswered questions for example is lance henriksen that strapped for cash that he has to keep playing supporting roles in these godawful pumpkinhead sequels is henriksen contractually banned from doing any nonpumpkinhead movies cant the creators of this franchise do better than a monster that looks like a geriatric emaciated alien who walks like he has a stick jammed up his a when are the hick characters in these movies going to realize that handguns and rifles dont hurt the pumpkinhead why dont they try jamming another stick up this things a instead and lastly are the writers of this movie so creatively challenged that they couldnt come up with names for the two feuding families more original than the hatfields and the mccoys while youre at it why not write a screenplay about a fictional president and name him george bush someday i may have the mental stamina to watch this movie all the way through without drifting off to sleep until then if somebody has the answers please let me know
