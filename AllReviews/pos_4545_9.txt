POS well of course the critics hated it this isnt a movie thats going for the bigtime critical acclaim but the fact is that its really very goodbr br sure if you dont like that chris farley brand of physical comedy or the exceedingly dry wit of david spade youre not going to like it but for the rest of us the movie has many hilarious and for that matter quotable sequences and the plot isnt half as dumb as that of black sheep the parts that arent meant to be humorous are actually done well not what youd expect from a movie of this ilk and the acting is really pretty goodbr br tommy boy is without question chris farleys best movie i give it an a and suggest you give it a view
