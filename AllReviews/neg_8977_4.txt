NEG deep sea d is a stunning insight in to an underwater world only a few have had the opportunity to view first handbr br from the opening sequence when a wave rushes towards the audience momentarily engulfing us in the ocean the filmmakers make full use of the imax format a jelly fish field appears to fill the whole theatre a shark powers towards us predators pounce from behind rocks and devour their prey it is a beautifully captured under sea feast for the eyesbr br our ears on the other hand are not given the same treatment the film is narrated by hollywood stars jonny depp and kate winslet both sound so ridiculous it positively spoils the enjoyment of the visuals depp sounds slightly bored whilst winslet sounds as if she is reading a bedtime story to the village idiot i was shocked that an actress of her status could have pitched her performance so wrongly the script is fairly silly and contains very little depth the soundtrack is filled with strange unrealistic sound effects which i assume are meant to be funny but in fact detract attention from the material which should have been allowed to speak for itself br br danny elfman has provided an excellent score which gives plenty of impact to the ups and downs of life under the sea when it is allowed to play out without the silly bubble sounds or crayfish footfalls which pepper filmbr br the film is a technical marvel but with its childish script annoying narration and misplaced sound effects it cannot be taken seriously
