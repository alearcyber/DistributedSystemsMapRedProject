NEG its a shame really that the script of this film had more holes than you could shake a stick at mixed metaphor intentional because kinski and coyote  both supremely talented performers who are capable of great subtlety and nuance  have wonderful chemistry together and the alwaysprovocative fairuza balk didnt hurt the mix either jeremy piven would have been great here too if his character and all the other supporting characters hadnt been written as a plot device as for the main proceedings the writers just didnt know how to create the suitable guiltyorinnocent tension for kinskis character  instead they gave us confusion contradiction and by the finale downright letshopetheviewersdontnotice claptrap
