NEG some things just wont stay dead they just have to keep coming back for more whether we like it or not i guess some people like to beat a dead horse the first ghoulies was a surprise hit and its first sequel was an even better film the third film took a more comical approach and by this point the little buggers were starting to overstay their welcome i guess someone out there in hollywood thought it was a bright idea to resurrect the franchise but the outcome will likely disappoint fans of the previous entriesbr br pros the acting is actually pretty good for a movie like this a silly but fun score moves at an alright pace some cheese for those who love it some pretty good actionpacked sequences has a bit more plot than the others and unlike ii  iii at least attempts to link itself with the originalbr br cons not nearly as much fun as its predecessors though it has more plot than before its a pretty ridiculous one poor effects the original ghoulies only appear in flashbacks and here theyre replaced with two trolls who serve no purpose other than to be comic reliefs speaking of comedy all attempts at humor are lame is a direct sequel to the first film but there are so many loose ends for example i thought jonathan was done with black magic after what happened in the original not that it was spectacular in the others but this films direction is especially blandbr br final thoughts the first three ghoulies movies are a bad movie lovers dream this fourth and so far final sequel lets hope is a bit of a letdown sure theres some fun to be had but it just isnt the same the others are low budget too but the people involved put a lot more into them see if youre a completeist or you wanna see beautiful women in skimpy outfits otherwise just stick with the other threebr br my rating
