POS yes indeed we have a winner a winner in best dumbactionmoviebr br the only reason i chose to vote a  for this movie is because its so incredibly badmade that it actually becomes funnybr br night hunter is basically about jack cutter a vampire hunter vampire hunters have been in his generation for centuries apparently and his mission being that he has to kill the last remaining vampiresbr br this movie contains one of the cheesiest scenes i have ever seen in my life not to mention the really bad gunshooting scenes when people are shot in this movie blood splatters thick as ketchup all over the place this makes the movie seem so cheap and lame that you just lose interest a constant shaking of the camera is what annoys me the most during the fightscenes this is i suppose done to create an actioneffect though in my opinion it gives no effect whatsoever its completely ridiculous br br all stuntscenes are done extremely badly eg a scene where the dead vampireleader gets thrown off a roof when the corpse hits the ground it bounces like a wobbly rubberdoll a scene where jack sniffs the ground getting a vision was so lame it got me laughing hystericallybr br lame music cheesy scenes bad acting and plain dumb filming techniques are obviously the functions that make this movie such a malfunction to state that this is a good movie would be the same as stating that nuclear bombs are good for humans clearly those of you who say that this is one of the best actionmovies havent seen many in your lifebr br this is basically a bclass vampireactionmovie that deserves  but which ill give  just for its ability being the lousiest actionmovie i have ever seenof making me laugh and because i just cant live without it
