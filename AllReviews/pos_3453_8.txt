POS wow an amazing lost piece of australiana and a lost s glamrock film rolled into one this film warrants viewing simply to see what can be done with next to no budget but a lot of enthusiasm as a retelling of the oz story the film borders on becoming too obvious but it is saved by its eccentricities the chance for a glimpse at how glam rock manifested in australia will delight fans of the genre this film used to be double featured with the rocky horror picture show an indicator of the type of film that oz is while not as frivolous or well constructed as rhps its hard not to have fun with ozbr br surprisingly oz has aged well perhaps a byproduct of how determinedly set in the real australia of  it is the passage of history shows that many of the ideas being explored would eventually enter the mainstream the willingness of the film to give prominence to gay characters is notable especially as it dates to the revolution period for the australian gay rights pushbr br the performances range from flinchingly amateur to finely nuanced brilliance the direction is lacking in subtlety and much of the dialogue may have benefited from an extra draft or two somehow these flaws add to the appeal of the film which is mercifully unpretentious much like australia in the s this film has a certain naive charmbr br there are several connections to the original australian stagings of the rocky horror show which will keep obsessives on their toesbr br oz is most certainly a minor classic and a potential cult favourite worthy of review laugh at the atrocious s fashion swing along with the ausrock soundtrack leave any expectations at the door and oz is likely to delight
