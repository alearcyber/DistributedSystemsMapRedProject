NEG my best guess is this piece of work will come out on dvd sometime before christmasbr br this movie was terrible the time line jumps all over the place this wouldnt be so bad if it left some suspense for the end it was entirely predictable bitch girls pick on outcast outcast wants to know why they hate her so much bitch girls die a terrible death outcast girl goes home and looks crazy outcast girl brought evil spirits with her makes neighbors go crazy and kill each other creepy kid understands whats going on oh and the younger sister not being good enough for mommie sick mother sending younger daughter to bring the golden child home br br to be fair there were some great moments here and there first of all sarah michelle gellers character dies in the first few minutes definite plus didnt see that one coming i didnt expect the wife to pour bacon grease on her husbands head either if the movie had kept up those kind of thrills i would have loved it the beginning showed so much promise br br i was disappointed because i enjoyed the first one it made me jump i didnt expect most of what happened and though i questioned some of the movie it was still a fun watch i didnt watch any previews for this the sequel because i wanted to be surprised i was but in the wrong direction
