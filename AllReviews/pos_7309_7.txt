POS the film begins with a dowdy housewife norma shearer finding out that her husband rod la rocque had been cheating on her three years pass and apparently theyd been divorced during these years due to the infidelity oddly during this time la rocque did not see shearer or his two kids as shearer took them to parisbr br marie dressler is a rich society lady and she has invited a new and improved norma to come to her house for the weekendostensibly to help marie break up a budding romance between her daughter and la rocque apparently norma is now a supervamp and with her magical sex appeal she can break up the romanceand no one seems to realize that she and la rocque were married several others are there for the weekend and immediately norma is a hit with her gay carefree sexy waysand almost all the men including la rocque are captivated by her neither tells anyone that they were married but its obvious that her ex wants the new and improved norma back this film is a sophisticated comedy of manners among the uppercrustsimilar in some ways to jean renoirs the rules of the game oddly despite the severity of the depression such films about pretty rich folks were pretty popular though many today will doubtless find them a bit too droll in spots however fortunately in let us be gay there are plenty of cute and funny moments particularly towards the end when marie dressler shows her true colors while not a great film it certainly is a good one and more than just another timepasser my only real regret is that i didnt love the very end youll just have to see it for yourselfperhaps youll agree about the ending perhaps you wont but im pretty sure you will enjoy this clever film
