NEG when i saw alien vs predator a few years ago i have to say as stupid as a sequel it was it was still somewhat enjoyable now there are unfortunately a shortage of good movies out in the theater lately so my boyfriend and i decided to just go ahead and see what avpr aliens vs predator  requiem was about so we saw it a couple nights ago and i have to say that there was absolutely nothing thrilling about this horror sequel it took a completely different turn from the first avp movie its not a bad idea that they took alien and predator and put them in the up class suburbs but from the idea of the first one explaining their reasons for existing this was just an average and predictable horror sequel not to mention a story that keeps introducing new characters every scene where i wasnt sure who to keep in mind on who was the main character and why so i couldnt really keep up with the storybr br from what ive gathered of course the predator and the alien are up in space having to deal with the stuff of typical sit com neighbors theyre just beating the lights out of each other and they decide to why not go ahead and take it out on some earthlings so they crash and alien is taking over the suburbia utopia but teenagers including a troubled couple who look like ken and barbie a female marine and her daughter among others are going to make sure to kick some space butt that is if the predator doesnt get there first because he is ticked off at the alien i guess for starting the party without him lol just kidding actually for killing some of his friendsbr br avpr aliens vs predator  requiem isnt the worst movie by any standards its still pretty cool with a lot of the visual effects and the fight sequences between alien and predator are so cool to watch like the first sequel of alien vs predator the cast is the thing that ruins the film and just seems like they were not well developed i know its horror but the original alien and predator films had characters that you cared about and wanted to win but it was a semidecent sequel that i would say is worth a look for some fun especially for ken and barbies sakebr br
