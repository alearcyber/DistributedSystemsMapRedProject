POS its just that chucky  was good chucky  was better chucky  sucked now the th in the series which is in my opinion the best out of the series jennifer tilly was just great in this movie for dolls they were better than a few actors that come to mind freddie prince jr for one and funnier than many comedies ive seen in the pastbr br the plot wasnt great but i really didnt care about it just to see chucky and tiffany bicker and fight each other and the ending leaves it wide open for a th sequel which i hear is in the works idle hands premiers next week and looks to be another horrorcomedy but i doubt itll top this one
