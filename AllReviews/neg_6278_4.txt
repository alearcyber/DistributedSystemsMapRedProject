NEG i am not a big fan of the spielbergcruise version of this film and so i must throw in with the more humble latthowel version c thomas howel had more heart and more sympathy that cruise in the lead role at least in my opinion now this is hard to imagine until you strip away everything thing in the spielberg version that cost more than a thousand dollars there would be nothing left no special effects no sets no cruise because i doubt that anything cost more than a cool grand in the david michael latt version so comparing apples to turnips i guess i have to go with the turnips at least it gives independent movies a shot at the epic science fiction disaster market
