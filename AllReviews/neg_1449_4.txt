NEG i wasnt expecting much from this film but was eager to try something which i initially thought would primarily be an early s teen horror although three teens are somewhat critical plot it is by no means a teen horror filmbr br the power is about a little aztec idol that exchanges many hands as its possessor who must be adult and thus corrupted becomes the vessel for unleashing all of the idols evil and often with deadly implications for not only the victims of the possessor but of the possessor himself after making several exchanges in vying over control of this thing three teenagers wind up finding it and cant figure out what it is except that since they found it strange and dangerous things are afoot they offer to explain the situation to a news reporter who doesnt buy into the spiritual bologna although it is her producer who wants to investigate further especially if it means he can get control of the idol i presume the teens are even not yet corrupted enough to feel the dangerous desires encouraged by the idol it is a story told a thousand times particularly in s and s horror and science fiction farebr br this one was at least for me able to sustain some interest though low budget it was not done so obviously cheaply or loaded with bad acting as many of the lowbudget comeandgo horror fare of the earlier decades had nowadays they have the same cheesy qualities but bigger budgets we are spare enough of it to at least allow ourselves an opportunity to become at least a little bit absorbed with the eerie atmosphere and so forth despite a story of clichs and though not terribly gory the special effects were done nicelybr br again it is routine horror tale especially with the ending which by modern standards has become a device that is annoyingly overused but one that is not so embarrassingly bad it might be worth checking out even if just for laughs
