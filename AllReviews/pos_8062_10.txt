POS as good as schindlers list was i found this movie much more powerful as it is a documentary and based on real life it details the story of the frank family and anne in particular although it is a bit slow moving at first detailing their family life before the war it becomes very powerfulbr br due to some of the footage and photos of the camps i would not recommend it for children but for adults it illustrates the horror of the holocaust through one young girl highly recommended
