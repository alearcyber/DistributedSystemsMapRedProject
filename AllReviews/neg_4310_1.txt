NEG admittedly you can put a model airplane against a black background and call it scifi and thats enough to get me interested so if you are like that black horizon will at least get you interested before you watch it the best part of the movie is when they rehash some actual footage of a shuttle launchbr br the movie plays like the naked gun series spoofing cop dramas with bad clichs and bad acting unfortunately i dont think they meant to be funny the actors really are made of cardboard the dialog really does suck so well just have to laugh at them and not with thembr br on a side note it is rare to see a movie that takes place half in outer space half on earth and doesnt mix in the expected extraterrestrials and supernatural events i really do ache for more realistic drama based on our space endeavors
