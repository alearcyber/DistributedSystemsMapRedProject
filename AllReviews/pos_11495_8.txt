POS i get the feeling that lisa krueger is easy to overlook i personally found her first film s manny and lo to be a wonderfully detailed character study and the performances were uniformly wonderfulwith special credit to mary kay place the film played for a week or two in major urban centers and vanished one or two critics really liked it but many viewed it as slight kruegers second film committed was released this year  after nearly two years of delays and it similarly vanished and once again critics dismissed the film as slight and pushed the film aside at most praising heather grahams screen presence but rarely her acting ability and once again for me committed is a solid success i feel as if krueger has a genuine voice and a personal visual style and these are traits that shouldnt be so easily ignored simply because she works on a very restrained canvassbr br the title has several meanings but mostly it refers to joline grahams refusal to let her husband carl luke wilson flake out and leave her she follows him from new york to el paso and becomes one of the most appealing stalkers in recent cinematic history her respect for her marriage vows leads her to mexican mysticism and selfdiscovery and yep the plot is just that simple and thus just that easy to ignorebr br joline of course is the crying voice of a generation whose parents divorced at a rate nearing fifty percent and for me her personal revolution against broken promises and a legacy of deceit is fairly intelligent and powerful confident in the belief that people just dont have enough faith in each other joline inevitably has to discover that her beliefs arent in synche with those of society at large several comments her have referred to her character as onedimensional and im afraid that thats a simplistic reading of the film or perhaps even a misreading if joline were just an innocent she wouldnt be interesting at all its the fact that she understands the world and refuses to play by the rules of the normals that makes her so interesting sociologically shes a complete deviantbr br krueger sometimes falls into moments of cutesy dialogue and her direction of this film has a rather odd overreliance on shots of clouds moving across the el paso skyline however her mistakes are fairly rare and in this film as in manny and lo its the performances that carry the day graham has never been better because shes never had a character as perfectly tailored to her as joline for the first time in her career graham seems comfortable playing an adult even one in slightly arrested development she carries the film perfectly luke wilson and casey affleck as jolines brother both have a number of fine moments as do alfonso arau as a mexican mystic and mark ruffalo and tbo the slightly psychotic truck driver as in manny and lo the characters are part of their environments well detailed totally organic creations these characters may sometimes seem pointlessly quirky but they make sense in their context even goran visnjic as an artist turned on by jolines devotion fits in in some strange way even though his characters foreigness is never discussedbr br for me this is a movie that gains depth looking back another commenter here spoke of the stereotypical mexican portrayals and again im tempted to call that a misreading joline is looking for selfjustification she knows that her commitment is out of control but shes looking for any spiritual avenue that can help her make sense of herself araus character understands that most people dont believe in him and he plays up his own faith when he sees a woman who respects him br br i guess i can understand how this movie could be viewed as underwhelming id simply disagree its consistently funny frequently hilarious and all of the characters exude a warmth which is quite wonderfulbr br im giving this one a  and when i log in the vote here thatll go up to an
