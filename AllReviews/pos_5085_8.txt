POS some people think this was a rather bad tv series with cheesy effects considering it was filmed between  but really look back at those years and think we didnt have computers back then so if you think about it its a rather good tv seriesbr br i always figured bad ratings killed the show but no the network did they canceled out their theme as the superhero network and abandoned a short lived spiderman series if it had gone on it probably would have run well into the s and if it was really lucky and i mean really lucky the early sbr br and no one wanted to pick this series upbr br anyways jolly old or young nicholas hammond of the sound of music fame is brought to the tv screen as peter parker the secret identity of the amazing spiderman along the series peter deals with a clone a beautiful girl from a foreign country and a corrupt politicianbr br while the series is way out of timeline being that peter is already graduated from university and thats when he gets bit and uncle ben is already dead the audience is treated to action suspense and the attitude that the characters have towards peter and his alter ego spidermanbr br while its also slightly disappointing that robert f simon looks nothing like jjjameson its not so disappointing that betty grant isnt betty grant but a hot african american girl who reminds me of halle berry who is one of the hottest women on the planet so really this one wasnt so badbr br but considering the time and how much drama they packed into this one it kind of foreshadows what bad tv is today either way its entertaining even for todaybr br
