POS this movie basically is a very well made production and gives a good impression of a war situation and its effects on those involved its always interesting to see the story from the other side for a change this movie concentrates on a group of german soldiers who after fighting in the north africa campaign are send to stalingrad russia where one of the most notorious and bloodiest battles of ww ii is being foughtbr br its interesting to see the other side of this battle since we mainly just always see the germans simply as the villains in this movie those villains are given an humane face and voice and it sort of makes you realize that the only true enemy in war is war itself and not necessarily those who youre fighting against at first its kind of hard to concentrate on the movie because you always just have in the back of your mind that the germans are the evil villains but of course you get accustomed to it quickly and you soon adapt the germans as the main characters of the movie and you even start to care and be interested in thembr br the way this story is told isnt however the best its hard to keep track of the story at times as it jumps from the one sequence and location to the other the movie isnt always logic in its storytelling and features a bit too many sequences that remain too vague it also is most of the time pretty hard to keep the characters apart and see who is who it doesnt always makes this movie an easy on to watch but than again on the other hand there are plenty enough sequences and moments present in this movie to make it worthwhile and an interesting one just not the most coherent one around in that regard hollywood movies are always better than european moviesbr br the production values are high and features some good looking sets and locations though the movie wasnt even shot in russia itself it helps to create a good war time situation atmospherebr br the character are mostly interesting although perhaps a tad bit formulaic but i dont know for some reason formulaic characters always work out fine in war movies and strenghtens the drama and realism it also helps that theyre being played by well cast actors all of the actors arent the best known actors around thomas kretschmann was also at the time still a fairly unknown actor but each of them fit their role well and gives its characters an unique face and personalitybr br all in all not the best or most consistent ww ii drama around but definitely worth a look due to its original approach of the german side of the battle of stalingrad and its good production valuesbr br
