NEG spoilers i sometimes wonder what makes sequelmakers think that they have to explain and therefore destroy the mysteries behind iconic horror films the original hellraiser of  was an absolute masterpiece and probably one of the scariest films ever made the  sequel hellbound was also a fantastic horror film though i personally didnt like how the viewer got background information on the cenobites some of the alltime creepiest horrorvillains in the original the third part hell on earth  was already quite a mess whose makers obviously thought it necessary to add a dose of humor to the formerly incomparably creepy leadcenobite pinhead a typical s stupidity and therefore destroyed most of his scariness this fourth part hellraiser bloodline  is slightly more atmospheric than the third one but it lowers this quality by inventing even more silly and completely unnecessary background information about the cenobites and the opening of the gates to hellbr br seriously  did we need to know how the mysterious puzzle boxes that open the gates to hell are being made i think not and that is not the only mystery about the cenobites that is stupidly destroyed in this film the setting of bloodline goes back and forth in three different periods the film begins in a nd century spacestation when scientist dr merchant bruce ramsay attempts to close the gates to hell forever when government soldiers disrupt his mission he has to explain his reasons in th century paris merchants ancestor was a toymaker assigned to build a puzzle box by an aristocrat obsessed with the occult an evoked demon the princess of hell took over the body of the beautiful angelique valentina vargas since the only person capable of destroying the gateway to hell is the one who built it the bloodline of the toymaker would be cursed and his ancestors infested by cenobites throughout the ages the film which takes place in the th century the present and the nd century really is quite a mess i admit that the part set in the th century has a creepy atmosphere and is by far the best part of the film but its also its smallest part the parts set in the present and in the future are quite weak and filled with stupid and unworthy elements the films undoubtedly strong points are the terrific makeup and goreeffects the absolutely ravishing valentina varagas as the shedemon and pinhead doug bradley who in spite of having lost some of his creepiness still is a menacing villain it is an almost offensive idea for hellraiser fans however that pinhead is supposed be defeated by a ridiculous lightshow overall bloodline is not a complete disaster but it sure is an unworthy sequel to a series that began so brilliantly even director kevin yagher was obviously embarrassed about it as he preferred to be credited as alan smithee overall this is only recommendable to hardcore pinheadfanatics and most of them are probably going to be angered by another diminution of their favorite demons creepiness all others are welladvised to stick with the brilliant first and excellent second part of the hellraiser franchise and skip all the others the makeup effects in bloodline are creepy as hell but almost everything else is disappointing my rating
