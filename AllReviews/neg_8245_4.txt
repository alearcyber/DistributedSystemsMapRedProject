NEG im racking my brain but i cant seem to think of another movie quite like the valley of the gwangi a western with dinosaurs what could be more natural you gotta wonder why john ford andor john wayne never tried it br br the plot  while searching for a mythical miniature horse for her circus tj breckenridge gila golan tuck kirby james franciscus and the rest of the castcharacters enter a strange lost valley there they find not only the miniature horse but some other more fearsome creatures as well dinosaurs rule this place now wouldnt that be an attraction at tjs circus  a caged trex br br its not that i find the valley of the gwangi a bad movie i just dont seem to have enjoyed it as much as many others who have posted comments on the movie there are some parts that i actually find almost unwatchable for the first half of the movie there just doesnt seem to be much going on i wasnt necessarily bored but i did want something to happen plodding would be an adjective i would use to top it off the movie features a very contrived love story it feels forced as if the writers decided that the male and female leads just had to get together but the valley of the gwangi isnt a total waste there are moments i really enjoyed who doesnt get a kick out of the scenes of the cowboys on horseback trying to lasso a trex you just dont see stuff like that every day ray harryhausens creatures are impressive there are some really cool shots of harryhausens miniatures interacting with people and horses it might not represent the best of his work but the effects are very nice still at least in my mind these good moments arent enough to overcome the negatives as much as i hate to do it ive got to rate the valley of the gwangi a
