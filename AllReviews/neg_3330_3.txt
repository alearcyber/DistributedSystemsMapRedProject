NEG a group of  gold prospectors head into a mine that was recently opened back up after an earthquake of course they dont pay attention to local legend that something is down there and killing people this low budget  horror flick has a slight cult following and im not exactly sure why unless it is because it is so obscure ill admit the last half hour is pretty entertaining but the hour getting there is pure torture lots of walking and talking and our titular strangeness doesnt appear until  minutes in even in the extras cowriter chris huntley admits it commits the unforgivable sin of being boring i would forgive them if they were strict amateurs but this group graduated from usc so i would hope they know an exploitation film should be exploitive anyway like i said the last half hour is cool as three survivors battle the stop motion monster and there is a cool john carpenterlike score i wanted to see more of the monster but it is literally on screen for  secondsbr br even if the movie isnt the best code red dvd has given this great attention you have interviews and an audio commentary by director melanie anne phillips produceractor mark sawicki and cowriter huntley the tales about how the film was made are pretty fascinating and inspiring like a cave set being built in a backyard even more interesting are sawicki and huntleys usc student shorts which are actually all better than the feature production huntley was a pretty talented artist and it is a shame he didnt go on to anything else sawicki has worked steadily in hollywood as a visual effects and camera guy the films vhs is kind of legendary for how dark it was and im sure this is much better however you still get scenes where the only image are five helmet lights bouncing around in the blackness safe to say the original my bloody valentine is still horror film set in a mine champ
