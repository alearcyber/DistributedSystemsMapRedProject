NEG wow i thought eskimo limon was the most awful and embarrassing firstsex movie ever but i had forgotten that germany always tries to compete in this case the wellknown german film producer bernd eichinger was successful in producing even worse crap harte jungs is stupid not believable and predictable and above all not funny its almost a tragedy that so many kids went to see this in germany and im afraid also austriabr br tobias schenke  looks too nice to have no girlfriend and too ripe to be  and his character is too dumb to be true schenke tries real hard to make us believe that he doesnt know anything about sex but that doesnt help harte jungs seems to be made by someone who watched al bundy and took him too seriouslybr br the best actors in the movie are sissi perlinger and stefan jrgens who play schenkes semiliberal parents perlinger and jrgens are standup comedians who are not particularly talented in movie acting still their performances are the best and funniest in comparisonbr br a complete failure
