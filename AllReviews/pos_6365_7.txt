POS a lot of people dont think dan aykroyd is funny this movie proves otherwise aykroyd is brilliant delivering his oneliners in this comedy the only major problem with this is that it wastes far too much time near the end jumping back and forth from aykroyds character and the doctor who is pursuing him to prove hes a fraud the doctor goes nuts like doctor leo marvin richard dreyfuss in what about bob the scenes where the doctor is desperately trying to get back to los angeles are silly unbelievable and unfunny other that this aspect the movie really is funny especially the first half
