NEG so this is where columbias head of their short subjects unit got his directorial start eh yeahits none other than mr jules white who is credited or is it rather exposed as the director of this entry into mgms dogville series given cocredit as codirector is one zion myers whose name is heretofore unknown to us mr meyers was no doubt the guy who controlled the fourlegged thespians and was responsible for training and acting in short he must have been the dog trainer on the setbr br the title of this comedy short is no doubt a play on the mgm feature of the same year the big house which starred chester morris wallace beery robert montgomery and a stellar cast in support we must plead ignorance in regards to this title not having seen it up to this point sorryschultz but there are many of the doggie gags that relate to what weve read about the movie not to mention some particular character specific gags for example we observed a canine convict who stststuttered and deducedcorrectly that the bowwow actor was mimicking character comedian roscoe ates we later crosschecked with the cast of the big house and presto his name is there brilliant deduction one fit for holmes  watson br br the practice of lampooning popular features was already a tried and true practice in the realm of the comedy short it was one that seemed to draw no objections from the producers and copyright owners of the major films but rather quite contrarily received heaps of tassive approval after all imitation is said to be the sincerest form of flattery besides any producer would welcome even some seemingly irreverent parodying as for the movie itself we found it to be interesting in a sort of perverse manner seeing so many of mans best friends being so artificially animated into one long and boring sort of anthropomorphic gag seemed very tiring to we who make up the audience i mean just how many pooches were made to bark needlessly in order to achieve the illusion of talking br br when it comes to pets or animal companions as the politically correct crowd prefers we are quite eclectic favoring not only dogs but also cats hamsters and parakeets we dont enjoy seeing any animal exploited in such a nonfunnyextended play formatbr br as incredible as it may seem the step that mr jules white made from mgms shorts to heading up columbias  reeler production would seem to have been not only a tep up in the area of finance but alo in the artitic content we never thought that being producerdirector for the likes of such luminaries as the  stooges andy clyde and hugh herbert as well as some who certainly had seen better days such as charley chase buster keaton and harry langdon would be a step up cinematicallybr br in case we havent made our point yet were officially panning this one so view it at your own risk we warned you br br note  we read excellent accounts of both the big house and the laurel  hardy sendup pardon us hal roachmgm  in both mr laurel  mr hardy by john mccabe  and the films of laurel  hardy by william k everson  both books have our most enthusiastic endorsementbr br note  the prison picture became a genre of its own all owing a debt to the big house in pardon us laurel  hardy hal roach and its director did a first class spoofthe first of many for a prison comedy became a required theme for so many a screen funny man to come
