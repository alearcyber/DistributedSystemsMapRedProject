POS i saw the movie in  and like other people who have commented on it here  i went back many more times to see it over and over  i think  times in all just great is how i would describe it  i was taken by the sound track the beautiful panoramas of the south of france the life style the kids began on their own an ideal way to live is what they had set up  of course the powers that be have to intercede but when i forget that part i find myself wanting to be in the movie and live like that so good that it is available on dvd now  it was not around for years br br tlw
