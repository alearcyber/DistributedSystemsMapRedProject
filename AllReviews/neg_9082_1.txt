NEG its hard to believe that there are some people out there in the world that actually think this is a worthy charles bronson vehicle br br bronson is a good actor that can do more than tote a gun and knock off bad guys he was quietly moving in the tv movie yes virginia there is a santa claus and showed a lot of class and style in the sean penndirected the indian runnerbr br in the evil that men do however bronson again plays a character that sees injustice and sets it right with fists knives and of course guns theres nothing here you havent seen in the last five death wish flicks br br wait i take that back this has to be the most sadistic and repellently violent film bronson has ever had the disservice of being in not just repellent in the scenes of torture or the descriptions of torture but in the fact that these scenes were put in a film just to sell tickets and jose ferrer what in blue blazes was he doing here i mean he won an oscar for crying out loud br br okay sorry about that outburst let me just say that the evil that men do has to be one of the worst movies i had ever seen that was based on a book yeah thats right i wonder if it was written with bronson in mindbr br no stars watch death wish instead at least it was topical
