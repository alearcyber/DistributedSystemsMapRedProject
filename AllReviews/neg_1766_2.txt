NEG i was really excited about seeing cold mountain alas like most movies im really excited about seeing it was a letdown were it not for that miraculous invention called a dvd i think i wouldve put my head through the monitor i was so boredbr br i closely watched kidman and law when they meet because their characters are supposedly destined for each other yet laws face showed anything but dumbstruck love while kidman seemed to be counting the seconds until she could run back to her trailer zellwegers character is pure granny clampett as if we dont get it cornball banjos mark her every entrance and so over the top it was all i could do not to laugh ironically her performance serves to highlight just how stiffasaboard the leads arebr br ada nearly starves because she freed her slaves we never learn why more perplexing is why didnt any of them stay on as ada and her father were unusually benevolent and as shown in one scene it was a very dangerous time for negroes as theyre politely called here why didnt the neighbors teach her how to milk a cow or grow a crop heck why didnt she just sell the farm and go home and for all of rubys practicality when she dispatches adas evil rooster that kind of puts the kibosh on them having any more chickensbr br by the time her beloved finally returns ada doesnt need him or anyone else  which is the big joke indeed she may be physically intimate with inman but her real intimacy is with ruby who has turned ada into an berbabe version of herself did anyone else notice how they walked down the hill holding hands happy as two peas in a pod as they left inman behindbr br i doubt that minghella recognized this as he was too busy making an antibush movie inman tells us he is like every fool sent out to fight with a flag and a lie and adas father says i imagine god is weary of being called down on both sides of an argument these observations are historically inaccurate and insulting while slavery was the basis of the souths economy the reasons for the war were more complex it was incomprehensible for a soldier to think that the cause was a lie in fact most in the rankandfile were indifferent to it for filmmakers to stamp their views onto a period where such views were foreign to those who lived in that time is beyond obnoxiousbr br structurally the film is choppy and episodic law and kidman are miscast and have zero chemistry the script is little more than halfbaked dialog and an egregious bunch of clichs and banalities small moments like a bag of diamonds ugh
