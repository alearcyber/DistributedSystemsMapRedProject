NEG wowbr br reading through these comments i see a remarkable sociocultural clash theme emerging between the us and  the dutch the us pov appears to be that this is quite a good little movie parker being a likable hero the story a lighthearted rendition of what could be a glorified form of realitybr br all three dutch reviewers view the world through a totally different pair of glasses it seems they categorically and in surprisingly similar terms agree the movie is a disasterbr br far be it from me to take sides in what appears to be a dispute between cultures on this item as wide apart as the ocean that separates them geographically still based on factual observation  i saw the movie with my very own eyes  i suspect the dutch are not too far off the mark br br parker kane is poorly made utterly boring and really not worth the celluloid that was no doubt wasted in its creation
