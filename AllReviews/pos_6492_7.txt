POS in august daysdies dagost marc recha has given us a sunsaturated catalan documentarystyle road movie thats mostly a meandering improvised meditation on brotherhood and reclaiming the dead the beautiful sometimes largescale richly atmospheric  mm landscape images nice soundtrack and catalanlanguage narration are enchanting as a mood piece if one is content with a trajectory that hasnt much momentum and doesnt lead anywhere in particular filmmaker marc recha and his nonidentical twin david are the stars and the narrative is voiced by their younger sister marc had been researching the life of ramon barnils  a socialist editor who had been a family friend he felt he was saturated with information and had to take a break the break turned into making this film which seeks to capture the mood of the interviews with barnils associates thoughts about the spanish civil war the drought season they were experiencing the rugged landscape the recha brothers affection for each other swims and suntanned nudity and whatever characters or stories they ran into as they camped out of their van this leads to pursuit of a giant catfish and the temporary disappearance of one of the brothers in the end david has to go back to barcelona to be with his daughter and marc has to return to his project and there it ends i found it fascinating to listen to an extended narration in the catalan language with its blend of spanish and frenchsounding words perhaps linked with provenal this isnt a major film but it commands attention and makes sense as a film festival choice with its clean visual and auditory beauty and its way of playing around with genres and blending autobiography with fiction and documentary in a fresh and thoughtprovoking waybr br an official selection of the  new york film festival at lincoln center
