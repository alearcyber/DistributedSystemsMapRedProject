POS this movie is on cable sporadically and i never really watched it thinking it would be similar to the bruce willis film n america with the usual trite story about american freedom etc but it was not it was so much morebr br of course martin sheen is excellent i have never seen him in a movie i havent loved even if the script is bad because he is so talented kathy bates is the overbearing mom and does a great job the real surprise is emilio estevez who has not always been in the greatest films but also directed this movie please dont stereotype him from the breakfast club movie he is so much better in this and i wish he would do more noncommercial atypical hollywood moviesbr br the film is realistic as we see emilio home from vietnam during thanksgiving kimberly williams is passable as the sister who feels she is disgraced and embarrassed by the returning soldier her brother he is quite alienated from the family and especially at this time in us history this story is very relevantbr br i learned a great deal about posttraumatic stress and you will genuinely empathize with this character this is not a violent journalistic portrayal like platoon for example it is more of a character study which leaves us even more intrigued and concerned about the effects of war especially when one considers the young age of the soldiers who are victims with todays violence it is rare that a movie causes one to genuinely feel sad and shed a tear this does it and deserves recognition
