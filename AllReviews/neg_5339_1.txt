NEG ive been watching a lot of asian horror movies lately but this one has to be the worst so far it started out interestingly enough but lost momentum after the first  minutes of the movie the added drama scenes flashback sequences and serious plot holes left me hanging what really happened in the tunnel just something terrible who started all the killing if it wasnt the ghost what did she want returned to her no answers whatsoever overall not very scary at all and the movie makers need to come up with a lot better ideas than thisbr br one positive was the cute actress but thats about itbr br not recommended
