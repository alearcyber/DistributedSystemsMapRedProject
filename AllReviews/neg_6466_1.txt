NEG ladies and gentlemen may we present the worst of all disney remakes although the name of this movie is that darn cat it should have been that darn teen or fbi agent the cat didnt get any real good scenes riccis character was more annoying than funny doug e doug didnt get any good lines even dean joness cameo role couldnt save this movie the only really good characters were the towns only two auto mechanics but their scenes were only brief in all id say that if you are considering watching this movie go get something more intelligent like a barney video
