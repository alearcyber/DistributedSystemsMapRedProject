NEG i clerk in a video store so i try to see the movies were about to put out each week i dont have a problem with this in fact i sort of feel its a privilege not so with this film    after an hour and a half of our hero whining and growling his way through scene after scene i was truly wondering if they planned to get to the point i felt like i should be getting paid for watching this at home in my free time and if id known there was another hour to be endured i might have given up right then i didnt care about the characters the filming was unremarkable and ford made kissing look like a chore even the score was incongruous and jarring what a waste
