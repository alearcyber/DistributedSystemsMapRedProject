POS i can remember seeing this movie when i was very young and several times on tv since then i have always liked it i have noticed on the print shown on local tv that one scene has reversed film it is the one where they are hiding behind the rock outcropit looks like vasquez rocks near los angeles watching the indians ride by if you look carefully you will notice that suddenly all the soldiers are lefthanded it is only a short segment and i have to admit that it took me years to notice itbr br as far as history goes there were often expeditions to rescue white captives from the indians the direct connection for the final battle scene is the battle of beechers island in that action a group of volunteer scouts equipped with repeating carbines spencer carbines not winchesters were surprised by the indians and retreated to an island and held off several charges in the last charge they killed roman nose one of the more famous indian chiefs i have no idea if the writer of the script had this in mind but it does fit fairly wellbr br there are several guy madison movies that i hope come out on dvd someday and this is one of them
