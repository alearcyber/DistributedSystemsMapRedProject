POS i have a strong feeling that what you think of this film will strongly depend on your frame of reference if youve never seen a miyazaki film before then it will probably confuse the heck out of you if you have seen a miyazaki film before then it will still probably confuse the heck out of youbut you wont really care thats because i found that the first time i saw one of his animated films i tried too hard to figure out what was happening and whyand it impacted my enjoyment of the film now that i have seen just about every miyazaki film i see the bizarreness and just take it all inenjoying the beauty of it all in many ways these films at least to western audiences is like drugslots of strange and beautiful images that dont always initially make sense but sure feel great to see of all the miyazaki films this might have the most unusual and incomprehensible story lineeven more so than spirited away and princess mononoke or my neighbor totoro but like these and many other studio gibli films if you just sit back and watch you are rewarded with a fabulous tale but because it is so hard to describe and others have already done so i wont even go therebr br as for the artwork its very typical of one of these japanese films though there was one noticeable change there was a very extensive use of what looked like colored pencils for the backgrounds this was not a bad thing at allthe lovely pastellike look was very pleasing and unique in some ways it looked like a tiny bit of bill plymptons art style was infused into a typical miyazaki film with a high framerate exceptional character animation which imbued them with tons of personality and a great wowfactor this is an exceptional film for all ages though clearly designed more for younger audiences the totoro fans especially it is a bit scary here and there during the storm segments but there is plenty of great stuff for adults as an adult at least chronologically so i loved the cute stuff and applaud the otherworldliness of the filmbr br a great filmamong miyazakis best i dont give it a  because i am hesitant to ever do thatplus i did like a few of the studios other films a bit more particularly totoro but that doesnt mean you shouldnt rush out now and see itdo it and do yourself a favor
