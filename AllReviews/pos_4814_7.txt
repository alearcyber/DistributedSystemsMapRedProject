POS the late director john frankenheimer directed his first feature film the young stranger after starting out directing live television dramas in new york city this film came on the heels of the success of rebel without a cause in  james macarthur made his feature film debut as a troubled teen with a movie producer father played by james daly who doesnt establish enough of a relationship with his son kim hunter plays the mother who tries to bridge the gap between her husband and her son the film uses the popular juvenile delinquent angle of the time to tell its story macarthur gets in trouble at a movie theater with an overzealous theater manager played by whit bissell macarthur in turn has to deal with a police sergeant james gregory bent on teaching him a lesson the material could easily have turned exploitative laughable and sensational like any number of others of the period did however under the surehanded direction of frankenheimer the film is a sensitive portrayal of teenage and parental dynamics the dialog is realistic and most of the scenes hold up surprisingly well some of the scenes with bissell as the theater manager and gregory as the police sergeant are a bit heavyhanded and dated the performances are uniformly good though which is necessary for a film of this nature and about this topic to succeed this is an impressive feature film debut both for macarthur and frankenheimer  of  stars
