POS my introduction to a lifelong love of shakespeare my brother was  and i was not quite  when wttw chicago broadcast an age of kings it became a family ritual to watch including the reruns as an autumn series my father used to buy us a rare treat for the midwestpomegranates and my mother would pop corn on the stove wonderful acting from actors whose names meant nothing to me then although i will never forget the achingly young sean connery as hotspur but do now and they published the scripts in paperback so we could follow along and figure out the language i managed to memorize most of richard iii over that so glad to see it coming out on dvd highly recommended for all ages and any level of familiarity with shakespeare or english history
