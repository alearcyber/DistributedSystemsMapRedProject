POS it is a damn good moviewith some surprising twistsa good cast and a great script only a couple of stupid bitslike the rasta hitman scene this guys a professional but that has been commented on already the fact i had only heard one guy at work mention it before and did not have many opinions or reviews to go on made it even more entertaining this gets a higher score than maybe some people think it deserves but i have to factor in the low budget and the good effort from the cast it sickens me that some movies get made whose budget equals the gdp of a small countrywith a hyped up releasegood reviewsan oscar winning director andor actors and turn out to be so disappointingwith actors sleepwalking through their roles and uninspired directingwith predictable plot lines and a story with holes in it so bigsandra bullock could drive a bombloaded bus through it examples in my opinion are the terminalcastawaymatrixrevolutions extra points are awarded for the wardrobe department choosing great clothes for the castespecially paulina porizcovawho wears a rubber dress in one sceneand a jacket with cnt on the back in large letters in anothera sex scene which shows off her tight ass and a good soundtrack are added bonuses and pleaseenough with the tarantino comparisonsthis did not remind me of a tarantino flick at all and tarantino borrows virtually every idea he has ever had from other movies even if that is your opinionare we saying once a certain film or book is written or directed one waynoone can ever use the same ideas again get real this film has its own style
