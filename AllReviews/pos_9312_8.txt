POS the first time i saw this movie was on a flight between guangzhou china and los angeles it was a real hoot and made the trip pass with much less discomfort than the normal  hour flight i tried to locate a copy of it without success until i discovered a copy for sale on ebay having now watched it twice i recommend it as good entertainment my only real criticisms are that the choice of english translation words for the subtitles is sub par even by normal standards also the subtitling is little to small blends into the movie too often and frequently travels too fast to read well
