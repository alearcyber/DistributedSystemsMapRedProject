NEG mixed group of experts explorers divers and scientists venture a mile underground and go another  miles underwater to a spot even more remote where they find salamanders giant albino moles  and some big razorfanged winged computer generated creatures lurking about the cave is sealed off by a rockslide and then the monsters attack and start killing everyone off as they search for an exit and thats all she wrote with this lowaiming effort that even fails to combine action science fiction and horror on the most elementary of levels imagine if someone gave the folks at the scifi channel  million dollars to make a monster movie thats precisely what the cave is like almost startling in its ineptitude at times full of clichs and almost entirely dependent on the special effects to entertain the only difference is they had more money to build sets more money to polish up the monsters and more money to hire supposedly professional actors who give awful performances anyway otherwise its business as usual some of these movies are still fun to watch this one is not and there are loads of reasons why br br  it takes itself far too seriously and has no sense of humor whatsoever so you get a completely unoriginal and predictable movie that doesnt even recognize how unoriginal and predictable it is br br  the opening sequence serves no purpose whatsoever other than killing a few minutes and adding to the redundancybr br  unoriginal looking cgi creatures are not impressing anyone in this day and age br br  utilizing shakycam and quickcut editing for your horror scenes is simply lazy unimaginative filmmaking and why further obscure the action by making things too dark and adding annoying distractions such as fire and explosion of bubbles it makes these scenes not only difficult to see but also impossible to enjoy even on a nobrainer action levelbr br  even though it wants you take to it seriously the script is full of clichs the dialogue is awful and theres no attempt whatsoever at characterization casting yearoldlooking model types in roles as brilliant scientists and gruff veteran explorers might provide some eye candy but it completely kills the credibility of a movie that otherwise plays out completely straight sorry you cant have it both waysbr br  there were two exceptions to the model rule as they did decide to cast an old guy and an average looking joe these were the first two characters killed off br br  for a little diversity they also squeezed in a black guy and a chinese guy strangely neither are given much of a voice in this film and basically stand in the background as whitey discusses what their next move will be insulting br br  furthermore how many movies have to be made where a black character sacrifices his life at the very end just to ensure hot white female lead and hot white male lead end up together at the end ugh give me a break alreadybr br  much of the acting was horrible cole hausers performance was completely laughable the other male lead looked like he just walked off the set of a soap opera and coasted by using the patented dimpledsmilemakesalltheladiesswoon technique which is the pg genderswitch equivalent to mylargebreastsmakealltheguysswoon technique often used by ladies in rrated films either way his performance was completely phoned in daniel dae kim from the tv series lost and piper perabo also stunk up the room with their stilted and monotone line deliverybr br  was the ending a joke absolutely terrible please god we do not need a sequel to this garbagebr br so basically i wouldnt bother with this one unless youve never seen a monster movie before or if youre just really desperate and the only other thing on is the simple life the sets were good the bluetinted photography is ok and a few of the actors lena headey marcel iures tried their best so i decided to boost the rating up one notch to a
