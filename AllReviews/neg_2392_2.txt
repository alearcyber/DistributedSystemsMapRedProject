NEG a good idea let down by heavyhanded productionbr br quite a bit of the dialogue was unintelligible because of the level of musicbackground sound and this didnt help this reviewer nor did the welsh accents pretty impenetrable at times towards the end i lost the will to live trying to follow the dialoguebr br this movie didnt know whether to be a farce or a black comedy  and they require different approaches some of the incidents were laid on so thick that they only merited a groan some were so unbelievable even for this sort of plot that they made the story just not worth followingbr br the acting was in the main good  although the american just came over as a clone of the back to the future mad scientist the little boy was very goodbr br i did watch it all the way through but god knows why i cant remember laughing once
