NEG i thought this would be a fun comedy with no sex or nudity in it well theres no sexual content but as for being a fun comedy i only remember laughing a total three times during the green butchers the hilarity is centered around cannibalism and mental retardation which is just sick humor in a bad waybr br i should have walked out of this film and im kicking myself because i didnt in fact i shouldnt have seen this movie in the first place the only good that came out of this film was was the fact that bjarne and his brother finally made amends and put their ugly past behind them i advise any wellmeaning individual to steer clear of this grossout flick
