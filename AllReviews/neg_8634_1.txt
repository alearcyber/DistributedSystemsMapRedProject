NEG i know its hard for you americans to find european films on videodvd particularly from the s but please seek out the original version of the vanishing  title spoorloos   and youll see why the hollywood version of the vanishing screws up bigtime particularly at the finalebr br i really like sandra bullock kiefer sutherland and particularly jeff bridges but this is just so so lame compared with the original what where they thinking can you imagine seven with a happy ending with gwyneth paltrow running happily into the arms of brad pitt in the finale the whole point the original was such a major international success was because of the shocking finale so why do you accept this kind of shyte remake really avoid this and get the original
