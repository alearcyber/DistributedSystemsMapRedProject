POS mom should really be given a different title to distinguish it from all the other movies out there called mom or with the word mom in the titlebr br this is a vastly superior zombie movie to so much of the rubbish that gets churned out time after time and all end up much the same as every other zombie movie out therebr br it is so different and refreshing it almost defies categorisationbr br the kind old lady who takes in a creepy lodger who just happens to be a flesh eater who then infects the old lady who also turns into a flesh eating zombie or ghoul quite which exactly is not definedbr br there is pathos in the story as her son realises what she has become and while at first horrified attempts to help her by supplying food i shall say no more about that for fear of inserting a spoiler it is one of those quiet movies as opposed to guns blasting explosions raging car chases etc boring etc that makes so many movies all the same rubbish but still with enough gory moments to satisfy horror fans whilst also inserting sadness into the story along with nice touches of humour as opposed to downright silliness of some socalled horror moviesbr br there is a particularly nice atmospheric shot at the beginning of the film where the old lady is sitting alone in her room with only her christmas tree for company and looks so innocent but what she becomes oh my br br a gem of a movie and even if not your thing should at least be viewed if only once by any true horror fan
