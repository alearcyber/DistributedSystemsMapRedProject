POS accepted is one of the best teenage comedies i have seen in a long time it has an original script talented cast and it delivers an hour and a half of pure unadulterated funbr br it tells the story of a high school graduate bartleby b gains justin long who is not accepted in any of the collages he applied to so to avoid his parents disappointment he creates a fictional collage in the attempt to fool his parents completely he creates a fake website and turns an old psychiatric hospital into a school everything goes smoothly until a lot of other accepted students turn up on his doorstep now he and his friend have to figure that collage thing out not only for themselves but for the others toobr br justin long as a lead man is absolutely brilliant his character is as natural as he can be and the supporting acts are outstanding jonah hill as sherman schrader columbus short as hands maria thayer as rory adam herschman as glen and lewis black as uncle benbr br the humour is fresh and simple and most importantly funny right from the start to after the credits the plot develops so easy that by the time you stop laughing at the last joke you start giggling at next other along with all the fun the movie brings a very common subject to our attention ie the collage education if usually the students in the movie are united against the school government in this case they are united by the mutual desire to go to school and learnbr br yet the movie doesnt brand all other schools as wrong it just shows that there is another way you what they say if there is a will there is a wayand may be sometimes the children know better what they need than their parentsbr br this movie is an unmissable little story about the great opportunities in life wrapped up in the best format possible
