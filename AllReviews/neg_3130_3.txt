NEG dakota incident has to be one of the strangest westerns ive ever seen not good but definitely strangebr br a driverless stagecoach rides into the town of christian flats with all passengers killed its scheduled to go on but very few for obvious reasons want to risk the cheyennes on the warpath out there but linda darnell regis toomey john lund whit bissell and ward bond each have their reasons for going on and dale robertson who killed john doucette in a gunfight after doucette and skip homeier shot and left him for dead in the desert is so anxious to go hes willing to drive the teambr br of course the cheyennes attack the intrepid group of passengers if forced into a dry wash for cover who will live and who will die is the remainder of the filmbr br dakota incident came at the very end of republic pictures before herbert j yates pulled the plug on his little studio westerns were their specialty but normally of the kind roy rogers made this would not have been a rogers product br br in fact its beyond belief the characters arent ground in any kind of reality whit bissell is taking back ore samples from his claim but robertson discovers its iron pyrites fools gold toomey is a guitar playing cynic who goes mad from thirst darnell is after a cheating manager of hers but really doesnt know what to do when she finds him lund is looking to bring in robertson who committed a crime he took the rap for but has to bring him in alive for that hed require help but doesnt have anybr br but the worst is ward bond whos a united states senator on his own peace mission to the cheyennes in real life bond was a most right wing individual and im not sure this wasnt some kind of a caricature of what he would perceive as a liberal hes really quite the fatuous fool but i think that might have attracted him to the rolebr br i tried to get into dakota incident but couldnt and the ending was a bizarre fantasy to say the leastbr br give it three stars for the cast involved
