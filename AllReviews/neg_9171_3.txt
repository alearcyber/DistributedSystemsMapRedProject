NEG i waited a long time to finally see what i thought was going to be a fun caper flick and was shocked to discover shoddy direction awkward dialogue a lackluster pace unmotivated slapstick gags and an overall coarseness that permeated the film throughout just not funny the sets looked cheap the costumes by the usually excellent donfeld are garish and distracting even the title song is annoying the whole childrens book characters doesnt come close to representing the married couple whose life is turned upside down when he loses his job for a film that seems to aim a dart at the unfairness of welfare and unemployment systems the filmmakers have no problem in being unfair themselves allowing hispanic black and gay stereotypes played at such a cruel level the look of the film resembles any episode of love american style this is not a compliment tacky seventies fashions abound in this world of white collar theft that only lends an air of implausibility to every situation outside of a clever initial idea and two capable stars in jane fonda and george segal this dated exercise in social commentary comes off as forced and mean spirited to minorities especially to gay people if you want a better caper film youre better off with the hot rock with george segal and robert redford or whats up doc with ryan oneal and barbra streisand now thats funny
