POS this is an interesting movie i think its very humorous although the humor is very black fulci is good and funny acting himself its a really funny and truly crazy selfportrait of an artist i make horror films if i would make love films noone would buy tickets and its really sexy movie also almost all the time there is some action or tension going on and many sexy girlswomen maybe it goes to the core of why anyone starts to do moviesart in the first place its a real psychedelic trip maybe best seen a little drunk or some similar state of mind there is some really nasty gore scenes also of course because its lucio fulci as a matter of fact some of those scenes are quite disgusting anyway its one of the three best and most complete fulci films ive seen the others are house by the cemetery  zombihavent seen the beyond actually the script is overally to my opinion quite ingenious you could see this movie as a portrait of an extreme neurotic or a person who suffers from obsessivecompulsive disorder fashionable words the character has a compulsive need to confess crimes or bad thoughts especially crimes he hasnt even done and he questions himself all the time what if i have done it what if i want to do it have i done it do i want to do it he overreacts and exaggerates his thoughts im sure fulci has been interested of psychology and maybe even read something of the area in his house by the cemeterymovie for example there is a character named freudstein this is maybe the most concentrated and straightly personal movie fulci did i also like the simplicity of the photographypictures in this film only thing that disturbs me a little bit is the sadism especially towards women i dont quite understand why is it entertainment is it art is it horror anyways and overall this is really interesting and well made movie definitely recommended classic film at least for fans or anyone interested of this genre for the others it may be too much
