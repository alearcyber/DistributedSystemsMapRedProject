NEG ill give it a two because it has a lot of music otherwise it would be a onebr br i saw this movie for the first time tonight and its the first road picture ive seen i was expecting waaaaay better robert osborn says this is the best of the road movies if thats true i neednt bother to see the others the best thing about this movie is that it has a lot of songs in the first half but thats balanced out by only one production number with dancing in the entire moviebr br i didnt like the movie neither hope nor crosby came across all that well their characters werent very charming the movie was not funny at all most of the dialog was just lame filler there wasnt much action there wasnt much spectaclebr br the movie wasnt what i expected i was expecting more road but there isnt much they quickly make it to the palace and then most of the movie takes place there until the end i was also expecting a lot more of the famous road style of breaking the fourth wall wherein the characters talk directly to the audience or comment on the plot there was only about  instances of that one of those is an example of the nonfunny humor of this scriptbr br hope recaps the plot up to now to crosby crosby i know all that hope yeah but the people that came in halfway through the picture dont crosby you mean they missed my songbr br those are two weak punchlines but at least they are actually jokes much of the rest of the script doesnt even have any jokes an example is br br crosby remind me to throw you a piece of cheese in the morning indirectly calling hope a ratbr br thats not funny at all it barely even qualifies as a joke but thats the kind of nonjoke dialog that carries most of the movie many of the scenes dont even come that close to a joke just using generic uninteresting dialog likebr br crosby hey whadda ya take me for you think that you can just throw me to the dogs hope well why not you did it to me didnt you crosby yeah but thats because i was lookin out for us youre not lookin out for nobody hope oh yeah well then why did i pay the checkbr br the above is just from my memory its not exact but it illustrates to you what i meanbr br and so onjust generic dialog with no jokes at allbr br my grade a waste of time
