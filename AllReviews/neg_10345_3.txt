NEG the idea behind dead silence is great zombie outbreak takes place during an edgy paranoia radio talk show there was so much going for this film unfortunately as soon as the zombies made their appearance all was lostbr br the film is ridiculous and only those with a passion for cheesy bflick horror will enjoy it the zombies were soooo stupid they ran around flailing their arms they looked like a bunch of people putting on a haunted house for elementary studentsbr br i know this is a brief review but i just dont see the need to invest much into this its a dumb movie youve been warned
