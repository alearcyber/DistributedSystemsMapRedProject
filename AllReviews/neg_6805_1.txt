NEG for anyone who cares to know something about the real diane arbus or who values psychological veracity this film is abysmal arbus was a brilliant talented restless and troubled person but this film depicts her as completely selfinvolved and truly bizarre in her taste and judgment kidman portrays her as wan and vague whereas she was someone who knocked people over with her charisma the totally fictional relationship that is central to the film is quite unbelievable and robert downey is truly annoying in his smirking portrayal of someone who seems to think hes superior to the rest of the world simply because of his affliction the film depicts this encounter as being the source of arbuss interest in freaks which is a truly banal explanation for the inspiration behind some of the greatest photographs of the th century the mystery to me is why people of some talent and intelligence chose to be involved with this film in any way
