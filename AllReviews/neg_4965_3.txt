NEG i read about this film online and after seeing the generally positive reviews it has received and viewing the trailer i decided to check it out for myself what a disappointment it starts out well enough the opening scene was actually pretty tense but from there its all downhill i can see that the filmmakers were trying to do something different with this movie but by doing so they took all the enjoyment out of watching it those choices combined with the csi editing use of music and montage lack of suspense scares or humor really drag this film down theres too much foreshadowing and to many subtle clues so when the first twist arrives early on you already know how the movie is going to end i gave the movie three stars because i think the cast did a good job other than that i cant recommend this movie
