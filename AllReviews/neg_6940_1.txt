NEG i never thought a movie could make me regret the fact that i subscribe to the hbo service now i know better jack is usually one of my favorite actors but not even he could rescue this part not that he tried jack plays his usual wiitches of eastwick type character unfortunately it doesnt transfer over to the american southwest he is about as believable a cowboy desperado as pee wee herman there is no edge to the performance and for that reason the comedy fails he is almost to goofy the remainder of the cast was worse timing in delivering lines is apparently something that the leading lady had not perfected as of  and the others appeared to be just happy to be there my recommendation to those of you interested in seeing this movie is that you save your valuable time for something like watching paint dry
