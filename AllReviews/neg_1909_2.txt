NEG ho hum rich good looking kid gets in trouble poor girl falls in love with him jealous exboyfriend causes tension yadda yadda i actually laughed out loud in many parts of this movie because the next scene was so predictable and just plain stupid as one scene moved on to the next i often found myself wondering just how we got there like i had skipped a few chapters in a bookbr br the script was pretty pitiful and didnt have me or my wife caring much about any of the characters except the jilted boyfriend now if the ex boyfriend had gotten an axe and hacked apart the girl and rich kid then then we would have a movie and all the stupid dialog and leaps in plot could be acceptable but since this movie attempts to be touching and totally misses the boat and ends up resorting to the romance equivalent of divine intervention to try and jerk a tear it just falls very very flatbr br avoid this movie clip your toenails instead you will have more fun
