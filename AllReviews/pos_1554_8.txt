POS i too saw this film at a film festival but unlike the previous poster i found it both interesting and original in a sea of terrible features shorts are often twice as bad do to small budgets and poor acting awol however is a taut little thriller that hearkens back to the outer limits the performances are solid not that one would expect otherwise from morse or mcginley and the directing is sharp and on the money i personally find it difficult to reconcile the previous posters comments with the film i saw awol is quite aptly written by shane black who as is usually the case plays with the genre both paying homage to the stories pulp sensibilities while simultaneously winking at the audience and never taking itself too seriously all in all awol proves to be an extremely well executed and fun film
