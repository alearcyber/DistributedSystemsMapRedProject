NEG having already seen the original jack frost i never thought that jack frost  would be as absurd as it is boy was i wrong then again apix movies have a way of showing unbelievably bad material even worse than you might expect i believe this is the first apix sequel and it may be an indication of what to expect in the future more apix sequelsbr br its hard to watch this without laughing especially during the later parts of the movie in which jack frosts offspring which are essentially snowballs with eyes arms a mouth and sharp teeth start killing people with the typical comedic dialogue and silly voices to go with it they are shown both as puppets with a stick underneath to move them and as computer animation which i have to say looks very cheesy the computer animation surprised me as the first jack frost had no such effectsbr br id strongly recommend that you see the original jack frost before seeing this one both of which it would be preferable to watch with a group of friends to get the full amusement out of it and because it would make more sense sense being a relative termbr br now only if there was uncle sam
