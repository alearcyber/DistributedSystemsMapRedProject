NEG wowas a big fan of larry mcmurtry western tales and the lonesome dove series in particular i was sooo looking forward to comanche moon what a tremendous letdown maybe my expectations were set too high because of the all around excellence of lonesome dovethe story the characters the cinematography the musicit all workedbr br comanche moon by comparison comes across like a bad saturday night live skit the characters are completely colorless the dialogue is babble and the plot meanders mindlessly all over the place it seems like the actors are all reading from teleprompters i couldnt relate to any of the characters good guys bad guys not even the incidental characters david midthunders performance stands out in particular it looks like it was plucked out of an eighth grade middle school performance im sorry id like to find something positive to say about comanche moon but i just cant do it theres nothing there
