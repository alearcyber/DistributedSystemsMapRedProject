POS this movie was to me a fairly enjoyable watch i mean it wasnt great but it was one of the better horror movies of late it seems to have been low almost state benefit budget size but it has its charms like the lovely ladies in it the atmosphere was good also which is what is missing froma hell of a lot of horror movies these days the acting was your typical s low budget affair that being in case you dont know is that it is dud acting but that is what lucio fulcis movies were full of they like this movie had atmosphere what they were lacking in storyline and money etc they more than made up for in the horror  gore  atmosphere for the movie its selfbr br it is just a typical low budget horror movie that is watchable i watched it all the way and i love horror movies ive seen movies where i just turn off within  to  minutes or sit and fast forward it if its on video or skip scenes on the dvd this movie didnt make me want to do that i sat and watched it all the way to the end without wanting to skip partsbr br i would have liked it however if the zombie type folk in this were a little more scarier as they were about as scary as having freddy kreuger as your babysitter not but seriously though if they were a little better it would have been low budget perfection maybebr br the music in this movie was top notch stuff ideal horror music so it was ive seen horror movies where the music is good or average but it could have been better thank goodness though this movie didnt have nay of the metal music in itbr br ive been a diehard metal fan since  but in horror movies metal music spoils it the movie looses atmosphere a lot when any type of music other than a score is playing so im glad there was no music in this movie other than just your typical score which was rather creepy well donebr br it could have use profane grace  epitaph of shattered dreams on it though as it is keyboard music no guitars no nothing except really creepy keyboard tracks like track one forever sleep you hear the wind blowing all the way through it and some goose bump inducing keyboard music that follows it ever track on that cd is the same ideal horror music at its best it would have suited this movie perfectlybr br the only unattractive chick in the movie to me was the one who got chibbedkilled or so we are led to believe and hung up as a scarecrow only to get free and try to escape later every other woman in the movie was lovely indeed a big  out of  for them all except the one i mentioned abovebr br i wish that hollywood mainstream side of things would give money to romero and the guy who made this movie as giving it to them for movies is way better a decision made than giving it to a goon muppet called paul anderson of the resident evil mincebr br well done guys it is not bad not bad at all i loved the part at the end credits when they kept showing you clips of them making the movie behind the scenes not many movies do this kind of thing which i thought added a little to the movie as it also showed you some outtakes of sorts and thats always a good thing if you ask mebr br rating for this movie  rating for the lovely ladies in the movie  rating for the atmosphere in the movie  rating for the score for the film
