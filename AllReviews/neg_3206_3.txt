NEG critters  starts  i quote somewhere in kansas   a replay of the last few minutes of critters   as the recurring character of charlie mcfadden don keith opper is about to shoot the last two remaining critter eggs in the universe which we are informed would mean the extinction of the entire critter race which is against some sort of intergalactic zoological law or something like that charlies bounty hunter friend ug terrence mann is now known as counsellor tetra  is a top ranking official at the intergalactic council  orders charlie not to shoot the eggs but instead put them into a pod that will land nearby very soon the pod does indeed land nearby very quickly  charlie does indeed put the eggs into it but he is also caught in the pod which i presume cryogenically freezes him as its never really explained critters  then informs us that we are somewhere in saturn quadrant  where a salvage ship comes across the pod drifting in space the credits have barely finished  critters  is already stealing entire ideas  scenes from aliens  rick anders hove decides to claim the unidentified to them anyway pod  try  make a bit of cash out of it with the help of his crew ethan paul whitthorne fran angela bassett al bert brad dourif  bernie eric dere the pod is successfully recovered they get in touch with the intergalactic council  counsellor tetra say to go to an abandoned spacestation where a trade will be made for the pod  its contents tetra also specifically tells rick not to open the pod so in true horror film tradition rick opens the pod thaws charlie out  the critter eggs which hatch kill rick  escape into the spacestationbr br coproduced  directed by rupert harvey i thought critters  was a pretty useless film  rounds the critter series of films off with a whimper rather than a bang the script by joseph lyle  david j schow is both predictable  clichd the spacestation with an unstable reactor that will blow up in a few hours the protagonists only means of escape being neutralised early on so they are stuck the race against time to save themselves the constant bickering  arguing amongst the crew people splitting up  the loser who turns into a hero  saves the day yawn a lot of plot devices seem to come straight from aliens  it rips off star wars  with a tacky waste compactor scene the characters are no better  you probably wont give a damn about any of them while the other critter films could be described as comedy horrors part  cannot it appears to be deadly serious throughout critters  is also incredibly slow uneventful  dull its over  minutes before the critter eggs hatch  after this brief sequence its nearly the hour mark before their seen again why make a critter film  barely feature them it cant be because of the expensive special effects as they look like glove puppets anyway oh  how can a mere hours old critter operate an entire spacestation  set a course for earth how do they even know what earth is why did capatin rick want to open the pod anyway what is all that stuff about with the female scientist  a rubber alien thing that is mentioned only once why do the intergalactic council want the critters so badly why only send four men why is this perfectly good looking spacestation totally deserted again critters  looks cheap throughout with bland dark unimaginative sets  it even steals footage from android  for its ships  space scenes critters  was apparently so low budget that the filmmakers couldnt afford any optical effects  the ones it takes from android look seriously dated for the most part only two critters are used although somemore start to hatch but its pretty late in the day when this happens for most of the film they are barely seen  the effects for them are the worst of the entire series forget about any blood or gore as the critters only kill two people during the  plus minute running time which just wasnt enough to maintain my waining interest the acting is pretty poor as well with angela bassetts overthetop melodramatic reaction to seeing a few critter eggs particularly cringe worthy to look at critters  it is as cheap  unspectacular a production as you could hope to not see the ending of critters  has the universe finally being saved form the critter menace lets hope it also saves us  our local videostores from the menace of a part
