POS great music great dancing a sexy star swayze and actual sexual desire shown by a female character a very unusual event you rarely see female characters who are motivated primarily by lust and it is a nice change i also think the movie captures very well what it is like to be a teenager coping with issues of class and of having ideals suddenly come up against reality of course it is sappy at moments  it is after all a movie musical  but all in all it is a real pleasure  a fun romance and also politically enlightened this movie also has one of my favorite all time movie lines i carried the watermelon
