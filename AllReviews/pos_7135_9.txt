POS i had heard about gaming and dungeons and dragons before but i had know idea it could be like what i saw in the gamers dorkness rising these guys are so funny and fun to watch especially the guy who plays the bard or minstrel or whatever he has a gift for physical comedy and timing there is so much background humor and energy in some of the scenes that make you really think that at least some of it was improvised there on set the special effects needed to be worked on a bit but i saw it at a convention last year and thats one of the things they said they were going to redo and make better so its probably wicked now
