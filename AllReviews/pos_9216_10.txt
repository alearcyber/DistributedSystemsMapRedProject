POS this movie is awesome due to the fact that it showed how good cartoons really looked in the sthe animators were not lazy like they are todaythe cartoon had so much detail with very little resources they have with them compared with what we have todayif more people would request these cartoons to be rebroadcast then maybe all of the other s cartoons would be shown on television once againtherefore to finish my sentence i would just like to say that this was a cartoon that i grew up with and really would like it to be on tv once again
