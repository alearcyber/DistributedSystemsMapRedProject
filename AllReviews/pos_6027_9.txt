POS i was fortunate enough to see the last stop here where i live at the moving pictures film festival for those of you that dont know the moving pictures film festival is a tour of canadian made film in canada i was told just before the movie started that it was the world premiere and that it was on the verge of getting an american distribution deal which added to my excitementbr br im a big horror movie fan and yes i love the scream trilogy as well so when i found out that rose mcgowan was doing a ten little indians type of movie i knew that i was in for a treat rose mcgowan was the biggest name actoractress at the entire festivalbr br the best way i can describe it without giving away too much of the plot is that its not quite like scream and it certainly is worth seeing its set in the middle of a snowstorm it was filmed in vancouver bc canada at a mountaintop motel which adds to the suspense rose mcgowan puts in a great performance as thegirlnextdoor along with the rest of the cast and as for what happens at the end well the only thing ill say is that youll never guess the endingbr br sadly it probably wont make it into mainstream north american theatres because the only decent money maker in it is rose mcgowan but if you get the chance to see it i would recommend you do and if worse comes to worst theres always videobr br i gave it a  out of
