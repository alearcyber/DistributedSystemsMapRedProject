NEG flashdance meets meatballs iii or maybe it should just be called meatballs iv this is my friend wesleys alltime favorite movie largely because he still has a thing about jv cheerleaders as someone once said this is finemore than finebut as you get older you need to branch out whether you want to or not society demands itbr br gimme an f has cinemas greatest jv cheerleader mary ann played by beth miller who looks like a sweetfaced alicia silverstone from before her clueless days wesley hates millers other film the horrific teen wolf too made three years later where she plays a fickle southern belle much like martha smiths character in animal house personally i admire millers range as the two characters could not be more different and she is convincing as bothbr br anyway mary ann is a nave novice cheerleader from moline a member of the lucky ducks squad who comes to camp beaverview for cheerleading instruction shes befriended by jenna karen lee kelly the leader of the tough girl squadappropriately named the demons jenna becomes protective of mary ann after her main rival takes an instant dislike to mary annbr br later mary ann gets a crush on tommy hamilton the head instructor tommy is spending his summer wrestling with the dilemma of having to grow up and move on which is a problem as his only skills are teaching cheerleading and performing elaborate dance routines in the shower for the enjoyment of viewers who get off on that sort of thing phoebe daphne ashbrook is tommys longsuffering girlfriend she has a welladjusted attitude and an experienced perspective she even tolerates tommys flirtation with mary anntrusting that tommy will not actually take advantage of young mary annbr br while these four characters are solid and their relationships have a nice charm the supporting cast is almost as weak as the material they have to work with which is a shame because had they brought some actual comic relief to the production it would have been a decent film jennifer cooke plays pam a social climbing and terminally peppy instructor who is carrying on with camps moneyhungry owner bucky and there is another couple with a thing for the characters from mad max since nothing is very funny you are left with only a cute semiromance and some great dance routinesbr br an attempt is made to create some suspense by slowly leading up a final competition but unless this is your first movie experience the outcome is never in doubt and there is a backstory about some japanese businessmen bucky wants to get money from but it goes nowhere dramatically or comicallybr br then again what do i know im only a child
