POS the other reviewers are way waaaay off as to why the farscape show has been temporarily put to rest it has nothing to do with the quality of the shows slacking in fact the exact opposite is true they kept getting better and better  i have seen every episode and when you simply watch them in order you really become in awe how much cooler it gets as they move on and on and the wormhole  aeryn subplots are really very interesting and gave it more vibe not less before it was sort of chaotic slow and rather aimless they spent like the first two seasons running from this foe type but in the second two they were actually trying to do something  also i have never seen such a great fun blend of sexy gals and attitudes in scifi the blue girl  zahn  was cool but not sexy they literally got to the point where the gals were running around in leather corsets and high heels blasting aliens  now tell me what could be cooler than that br br the real reason farscape went off for a bit is because it was costing too much  and that is a good thing for the fans because the show watched end to end is really like a  hour long epic movie with all the cinematics of the blockbuster stuff ok ok they do use similar sets a lot but the cg is great and the gals are sexxxybr br blah blah  the real reason is because tv shows are about profit it is a business and the sci fi channel or whoever was not getting as big a return on this expensive farscape show as they could with junk shows like stargate lexx was actually cool until they got rid of the hot german girl and replaced her with this bizarre fatlipped odditybr br anyway yes remember this farscape kept getting better and better until it was really like a little real movie each week then the networks decided hey people will watch any old piece of drek we shove on the air as long as it is the only sci fi thing on at that hour so why are we spending all this money on farscape lets shove cheesy lowbudget stargate down peoples throats and call it a hit series because its like all we play every darn night lol br br thats the way it goes also i gotta tell ya that claudia black is a really cool actress after she got her facelift got the baggy eyes tightened she was looking really cool  one of those dynamic types like judy davis and sometimes hot looking sometimes ugly  like a roller coaster ride id par claudia black with lucy lawless in style and substance  both very fun to watch  not just chrichton  and yeah you may say the pregnancy thing was cheesy but how many sci fi shows have a believable and deep romantic subplot that actually goes somewhere and progresses it was legitimately cool as a romance story  the actors on the show are great it really is a shame the show is in limbo for now but i hope it comes back in more episodes soon and movies as well because i will deffinately buy them d
