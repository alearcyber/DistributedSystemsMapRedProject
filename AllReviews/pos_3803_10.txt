POS although this film never attained commercial notoriety my experience has led me to conclude that many welldone pieces of artistic expression often do not gain mass appeal the story line depicts a young boy stealing a car and embarking on a surreal dreamlike adventure with very little basis in our conceptualization of time and space therefore anyone who attempts to view this film from the perspective of its conformity to reality will likely be disappointed it is not intended to be realistic it is however intended to be metaphoric with extensive symbolism apparent to those with superb attention to detail in addition the symbolic representations are left open for interpretation which can be said of much great artwork dont be fooled by the cover if you happen to rent or buy this film the movie is not what it might seem to be on the surface
