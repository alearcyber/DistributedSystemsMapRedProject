NEG maybe spoilers hard to spoil this thing more then it is but just in case gees i dont see how anybody could have liked this remake it was like a made for tv show and still pretty lame for that lots of fake snow bad acting by top stars bad action and that crazy pine forest in detroit what the heck i didnt really think this would be a great movie but i was hoping to be entertained nope we fell asleep half way and had to finish it up the next day i could have skipped the rest easybut then i would have missed those great piney woods im so glad i missed this at the theater bad enough to have wasted  at the video store and i am a lover of cop action and drama films this was a very stinky  out of  stars give me the original any day
