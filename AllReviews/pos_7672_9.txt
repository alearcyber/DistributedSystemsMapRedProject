POS i stumbled on to this site while looking for a video or dvd of the  version porgy and bess with sammy davis as sportin life if anyone finds this on a home movie format please let me know i talk to my daughters all the time about things that they think are new which actually have already been done we went to see a live theater of version a couple of years ago and all i could talk about was this film sadly my daughters cannot remember seeing sammy davis jr in any production although they have heard of him needless to say theyre not familiar with the other great actors in the film it is a major oversight not to have this classic film because of the cast on a home movie format for collectors and for future generations anyway in my opinion this version was the best
