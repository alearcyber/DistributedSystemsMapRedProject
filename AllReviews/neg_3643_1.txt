NEG this is the absolutely worst show in the history of nickelodeon first of all no boarding school has a sushi bar flat screen tvs and gives every student a laptop this makes the show so unrealistic and boring the plots are pointless and incredibly boring the actors are so bad it makes me want to take my own life i really hate the fact that in the show zoey is the most popular girl in school and the prettiest and smartest and gets the best grades without doing any work she never has any real problems and every guy wants to date her she is so perfect there isnt anyone like that also i hate that everyone would do anything for her and everyone picks her for every team or club it is so annoying quinn is so obnoxious her experiments are pathetic pointless and fake chase is such a wimp he says he loves zoey but if he told her it would ruin their friendship how pathetic michael tries to be funny but he never accomplishes anything nichole is so perky and screams a lot she is never seen doing any work or studying but she is a straight a student lola thinks she is an actress but she sucks excuse my language need i say more i think no for your own good stay away from this show at all costs
