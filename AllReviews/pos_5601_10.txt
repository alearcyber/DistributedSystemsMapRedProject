POS the promise of martin donovan playing jesus was quite honestly enough to get me to see the film definitely worthwhile clever and funny without overdoing it the lowquality filming was probably an appropriate effect but ended up being a little too jarring and the ending sounded more like a pbs program than hartley still too many memorable lines and great moments for me to judge it harshly
