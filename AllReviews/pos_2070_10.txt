POS  ive seen branaghs hamlet branagh is too old speaks frequently with a high pitched voice unwillingly funny  not a convincing hamlet and his directors qualities  poor  see also much ado about nothing from branagh  the funny parts of the dialogues have mostly been cut out not speaking of the directors mistakes in the dialogue cuts  ive seen hamlet  i think the scenario is an interesting idea  but such lousy actors  all of them  orson welles hamlet is ok  but this bbc hamlet is the best derec jacobi is convincing  seems a bit of a lunatic  very suitable and patric stewart  wonderful and claire bloom is a very attractive queen you believe those actors what they are saying  i think this is the best compliment
