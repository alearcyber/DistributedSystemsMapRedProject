POS this is one of the best and most under rated teen movies ever madebr br i saw this growing up and it was and is one of my favorites maybe not as popular as fast times but just as greatbr br there is a serious side to this movie as mentioned by other reviewers it starts as a comedy and morphs into a drama about halfway through thats the beauty of it though and what sets it apart you get it all humornot unlike that of fast times  drama and a great great soundtrackbr br i personally think every kid about to enter high school should see this it would give an idea about the journey their about to embark on cmonwhat kid watching this wouldnt be able to relate to someone in the movie the fact that it becomes so serious halfway though is also cool and just superbly well doneyou dont even see it coming definitely a lot of surprisesbr br spoilersdont read anymore if you dont want to knowbr br great knee slappping humorwho could forget the scene between gary and camilla i can still hear itoh my big strong burrito pricelessbr br some of the scenes between gary and karin are hard to watchparticularly the final scene of coarse there are so so many women like karen out there who would have made the exact same choice she did think about ithow many women reject men with hearts of goldlike gary for jerks i know ive done itand so have many females i know this movie will inspire discussion and despite the countless times ive seen it still leaves me filled with admiration for the film makers and performers everyone will find someone to relate to in this movie or whats more likely more then one personbr br lastly the music used is just greata lot of cars ulots of obscurenow songs from the san s purists dreambr br but make no mistake it is not the music that makes this movie unique it is the story itself plain and simple one of the best of its kind and a teen movie classic
