POS let me start by saying that liev has gained a ton of respect from me after seeing his directorial debut everything is illuminated anyone who has read the book knows how saturated the story is with nonsensical and hilarious vocabulary by alex along with countless flashback scenes and crazy dreamlike sequences liev took all of this and made it work the movie itself is great  the soundtrack the performances the cinematography  it all works there is a lot of story missing about the town and its inhabitants but theres only so much you can do with an indie so this part of it didnt bother me too much its just disappointing that not a lot of people will see this movie or even know that it exists because of the lack of promotion that came with it i didnt even know it was in theatres i didnt know when the dvd came out youd think that since frodo baggins was one of the main characters somebody wouldve at least released a commercial for it i had to see the trailer on my paradise now dvd released on dvd in the spring of  to even know that it had a fall of  theatrical release date haha  sad reallybr br anyhow if you stumble across this review somehow because one of your friends read the book and loved it or saw the movie and are recommending that you see it  take my advice and watch it its a very good experiencebr br  out of
