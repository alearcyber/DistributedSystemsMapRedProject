POS i would give this movie a good strong  while it definantly isnt the greatest movie or even one the best movies of its kind the killing fields is better it does at least attempt to tell a necessary storybr br i think the method of introducing laura into burma was a bit contrived first of all burma isnt exactly the easiest country to visit especially in the late s secondly if you did make it burma your passport would not get lost a sane person would make darn sure they knew where their passport was at all times with that in mind im sure the screenwriter knew that was weak but needed something patricia arquettes performance was understated and i just didnt buy that she was a doctor however at least she didnt overact the role which often happens in movies like this u aung ko was good but also understated the end is hard to follow since most of the dialogue is in burmese with people translating for laura it would have been difficult for laura and is difficult for the viewer as well another plus is the strong se asian scenery in the film which was enjoyable to see
