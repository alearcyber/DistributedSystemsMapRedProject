POS peter lorre gives one of his most evil performances as the owner of the titled place the plot has a new government agent being put on the track of peter lorres character when the gmans contact his killed by one of lorres agents the gman is sent to prison for the killing even though everyone knows there is more to the story lorre has the man paroled into his care and brought to his island where he is mining diamonds lorre wants to know what our hero knows but he isnt talking and a battle of wills is set in motionbr br this is a good solid little thriller that doesnt quite make a great deal of sense plot wise but even so the film holds your interest i had put the film on last night in order to use it as something to drift off to instead i found the tale riveting enough i was up an extra  minutes lorre is the reason that one falls into this his quite demeanor is unnerving he does very little but its clear from his orders and the way everyone reacts to him watch how they light his cigarettes that he is a bad dudebr br worth a look if you should run across it
