NEG okay so gus van sant wanted to remake psycho in color so that he could bring it into modern audiences who would probably go into cardiac arrest if they were ever forced to see a movie in black  white while they conveniently forget that both clerks and schindlers list were filmed in black  white and are great moviesbr br unfortunately the same narrowminded people who wouldnt want to see a great movie just because its in black  white are the same people who wouldnt like psycho anyway because it doesnt have a murder or sex scene every two minutes and the murders are not the grisly bloodgutsgorebonesnapping that people are used to from having seen halloween friday the th and nightmare on elm street this is why remaking psycho almost exactly as it was originally was destined to not work because its really only of interest to people who are fans of the original everyone else is just watching it to tide them over until the next scream sequel comes out and for that reason they will be disappointed psycho relies on suspense and mystery not blood and guts and just so nobody thinks that i must be a senior citizen if i like older movies let me set the record straight by saying that i am br br so if doing the movie in color was all that van sant wanted to change why not just colorize the movie and rerelease it i mean whats the point of remaking a movie if youre not going to change anything the least he could have done was to put his own directors spin on it rather than just copying hitchcocks  or even better hired a new writer to adapt a new script from the original psycho book but it seems that van sant couldnt decide whether he wanted to remake psycho exactly or not this should have been an all or nothing project  either remake the movie exactly or do it differently  but as it stands this movie is about  the same but with a few touches thrown in that dont seem to have any purpose such as having norman masturbate while he spies on marion undressing it doesnt serve the plot at all and the only reason he put it in was because he could he wanted to say hitch couldnt show people masturbating in  so im going to do it whoopee big deal like im so shocked at seeing someone masturbate and what on earth was the point of showing single frame shots of clouds and farm animals spliced into the murder scenes and then he leaves out an important scene where lila and sam meet the sheriff outside the churchbr br plus by using the almost exact same script the entire movie seems a bit of an anachronism the opening credits say that the year is  then whats with marions ish looking dress or the parasol she carries with her why do marion and sam have to have their trysts in a hotel room when these days nobody would be shocked by what they are doing why are there no air conditioners in marions office why does the bates motel have no tvs in the rooms and apparently no automatic locks on the doors why does the sheriff have to ask the operator to connect him to the bates motel this was why using the exact same script was a mistake  just changing a few words here and there was not enough to modernize it it needed a whole reworkingbr br while vince vaughn turned in a good performance as norman he just didnt seem right for the part part of what made the original psycho so creepy was that norman had that innocent boynextdoor quality so nobody could believe that he was capable of such horrible crimes with vince vaughn playing the part is anyone really surprised that norman was a psychopathic killerbr br that said i can understand that gus van sant was obviously a fan of the original psycho movie and wanted this to be a tribute this isnt a bad movie but the problem is that this may be some peoples only exposure to psycho i really think you should see this movie only if youve seen the original since i am a fan of anything to do with psycho i bought a used copy of the remake which i may watch occasionally the original movie was a filet mignon whereas the remake is a hamburger but even filet mignon would get boring if you had it everyday so its nice to have a hamburger once in a while for a change
