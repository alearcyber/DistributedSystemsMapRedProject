POS definitely not only for urban legend aficionados campfire tales is an often scary and always fun ride through several popular stories it is also a film that exceeded the low expectations i had a horror film i had never heard or read about a straighttovideo release granted the latter often presents us with a pleasant surprise but with horror films nowadays it can be all or nothing a cast of mostly unknowns well ill leave the math to youbr br the film proves to be an entertaining suspenseful and overall very enjoyable experience the four stories are wellpaced and satisfying the only one i felt was a little weaker was the locket for the simple reason that it offers almost no explanation for its plot or the characters actions however i still loved the tale its atmosphere and ending my favorite one was the third story people can lick too  the suspense in it is not only palpable but also educationalbr br i found campfire tales to be one of those horror gems one discovers by chance and then goes on recommending it to everyonebr br
