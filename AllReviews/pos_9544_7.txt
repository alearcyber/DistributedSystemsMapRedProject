POS this covers just about every area of the creative process and goes through the three stages chronologically with the main focus squarely placed on the production there are documentaries that go into more detail and cover the other two groups better this consists of artwork behindthescenes footage clips of the movie and many interviews with a running time that comes in at just over two hours the audience is entitled to a lot of information given that this is nearly the same length that the film itself is it could be argued that a lot of the time is spent on the people with the craft and the result of their collaborative efforts coming in second this is welldone with tight editing it gets into the technology some and reveals how certain effects were achieved this spends a lot of time on the physical training in preparation for the fighting and such you do get nice candid shots of the people crew and actors alike the ultimate matrix disc set of this also holds nearly three hours of music in a simple system with individual track selection and a play all function about  minutes worth of bts material in addition to the title itself in various featurettes the original release however has several very brief extras including clips of the making of the sequels a preview of the animatrix and yuen wo pings blocking tapesa complete runthrough of a couple of the biggest martial arts sequences with stunt performers and almost the exact cinematography with the same shots and angles of those bits in the finished silver screen effort the language is quite strong but rather infrequent nearly nonexistent i recommend either version of this to anyone who enjoys the concept andor wants to know about how they put the first one together
