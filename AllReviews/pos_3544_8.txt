POS guess a few upscale film directors were sitting around sipping their absinthe grappa aramangac or jungle juice some night in the s during the cannes or other film festival and one said hey guys lets do a movie where each of us creates a segment around a world class aria welllllit kind of sort of worked clearly someone was smart enough to select some of the best recordings of the arias chosen for example bjorelings nessun dorma so if you were blind and lying on the floor just listening to the dvd you got more than your moneys worth not every director succeeded but more did than not and the flick seems to improve with each viewing over the years my favorite is the eerily beautiful love duet from die todt statd okay a young naked elizabeth hurley is eye candy but her husband singing to her his wifes ghost is incredibly beautiful with the love music second only to otello and desdemonas gia nella notte densa in all the operatic repertoire could the flick been better sure what couldnt not have been but its well worth a view especially of youre in a hyperromantic mood
