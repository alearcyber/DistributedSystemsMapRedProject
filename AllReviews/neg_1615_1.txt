NEG greetingsbr br i never thought i would see the day when i would be so disgusted by a movie that it would be a burden to finish it i was always a fan of horror movies bc and cs included but in this case its hard to describe how a movie could fail to qualify for any letters in that scalebr br the movie is centered on a poorly developed back story a mix of folklore with an after taste and to top it up the performance of the actors is questionable horror b movies usually fall in two categories  a gem that was under looked and under funded  so bad its funny laugh or your money back well this movie falls in between i wasnt scare didnt laugh so i guess if you really need to see it you could but i recommend you dont
