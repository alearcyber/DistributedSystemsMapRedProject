NEG i had heard about this movie through a friend it was supposed to be a thriller but what i watched wasnt a thriller it was more like a weak attempt at one amber smith was a bright spotthat may be giving her too much credit the scenes were she was in bed with actress erika michels were also lame the two actresses did not seem to click with each other at all amber smith was way out of this gals league and it definitely showed on camera she did not seem into those scenes at all i was disappointed because a friend of mineguy of coursehad pumped this movie up to be something great but it was actually more like watching dime store porn
