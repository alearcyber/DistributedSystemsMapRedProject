POS this movie would had worked much better if this was the first critters movie this is a lowbudget movie with only two  critters shown onscreen why this looks like a fail is because this is the last critters movie and its so lowbudget that it seems the director made the whole movie with his own pocket money however i did like this movie i compare it mostly with the third movie which were bad critters  have a more serious tone in it the first half of the movie even without seeing one critter yet you have a scary feeling watching it too bad they didnt milk out the critters i mean even if they only had two  puppets they could still have used them onscreen a lot more the critters also have different deaths in this movie which made this a little special especially at the end with the frozen critter ug has a promotion in this part and is different in this movie which took me by surprise lastly i liked this one because it also has some kind of conclusion to the series so at least we wont see a critters  anymore oh one last thing i missed one scene in this movie we never see a critter shoot a spike from its back maybe these puppets didnt have that feature but i was very disappointed not seeing that in critters  we see a lot of spike shooting which was the only good thing i liked about that movie
