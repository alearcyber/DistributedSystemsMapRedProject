NEG i would not recommend this movie even though it is rated g and is clearly for kids there is quite a lot of swearing including the dreaded f and s words this kind of language doesnt offend me particularly but in a kids film come onbr br there was also quite a bit of implied sexual content between one of the early adolescent male characters and any willing adult woman who came along  including a prostitute br br the acting was as good as it gets in this genre of film but the story line was very very cheesy and even my four year old remarked that it was stupidbr br despite having elizabeth shue this film is definitely not worth checking out if you havent seen it
