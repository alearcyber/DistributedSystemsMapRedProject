POS trey parker and matt stone the creators of south park finally get out of their grueling schedule to talk to the cameras while sipping champagne in their hot tub at first when watching this i did not sense as much sarcasm as there was in this i knew they were joking when they would complain about different actors on the show and when trey said he wasnt going to give his mother any of his money but there is so much sarcasm throughout that this documentary is more of a mockumentary full of inside jokesbr br this documentary shows everything about south park up until the second season anyways it shows what goes on behind the scenes with the animation and the recording it has interviews many of which are fake interviews but some amongst all the fabrications give insight into the show clips from both of trey parkers spirit of christmas shorts are shown as are many good clips from the show if you were a south park fan then this should have quenched your thirst for show knowledge back in late  when this was made now obviously the show has changed but this is still interestingbr br what we have here is an amusing documentary where trey parker especially and matt stone come off as arrogant jerks and thats exactly what they wanted to come off as they may be this way in real life but here it was a joke a  minute long insightful jokebr br my rating  out of   mins not rated contains language and sexual content
