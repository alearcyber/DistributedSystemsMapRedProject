POS there is absolutely no doubt that this version of tarzan is the closest to burroughs vision while he gladly collected his royalties from the films produced during his lifetime he frequently made it clear that they were little more than the bastard children of his tales the film studios ludicrous obsession with casting olympic swimmers as tarzan was beyond laughable i guess we should consider ourselves lucky that they did not set their sights on shotputters br br prior to this film the most faithful adaptations were in comic strips and comic books as fine as some of these were we had to wait seven decades for a filmmaker with the integrity to respect the character as he had been created
