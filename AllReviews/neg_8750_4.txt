NEG for all its many flaws im inclined to be charitable towards thing there is the nugget of an interesting creepy claustrophobic hitchcock style story here put this in the hands of a writer like theodore sturgeon or if you prefer british perspective robert bloch or the guy who wrote day of the triffids and you might have had a nasty unsettling little spook story that was the best thing in an book anthology of horror and suspense storiesbr br however someone chose to tell this story as a feature length movie and a cheap nd rate at that and so most of the potential is wasted a story like this really needs a voice like sturgeons to bring out interesting quirks of character in a better light his classic story the widget the wadget and boff is an example of how he can gather together an isolated group of ordinary characters and in the space of  pages can turn them into the most amusing sympathetic and fascinating people youve ever met a good writer can with a few chosen words make the reader see some of the most vivid and memorable events ever to scar his emotionsbr br instead we get a movie where some of the most irritating and unlikeable characters ever made are lumped together and made to interact in unconvincing where did that come from moments that just lie there ie the blond psychic girl declaiming that youre all evil and i hope you are destroyed we get leaden pacing and slow motion blocking and dull sets and stiff actors i blame the director for the stiff and shallow part these are all rd rank character actors who never made the big time but they are also real actors and a good director could have gotten better performances out of them we get uncalled for lesbian overtones that make the viewer feel uneasy and exploited without delivering any kind of payoff if im going to have my baser instincts exploited and feel guilty about it i want done by stuff staged better than this and we get over an hour of creepy buildup diffused in about  seconds in one of the worst anticlimaxes ive ever seenbr br good things about thing um wellsome of the closeup shots of the warlocks head silently mouthing its directives were pretty effective the miserly and shrewish widow rang true to life even if i wanted to stuff a sock in her mouth the first scene where the big simple ranch hand silently turns on the oily cowboy and kills him had a bit of shock value because the plot had taken the trouble to establish the big guy as a fairly sympathetic character and like i said earlier the idea of an insidious force from the past turning the members of an isolated community against each other is a good one and can sustain interest far above the actual merit of a bad performancebr br which this definitely isbr br but as i said im inclined to be charitable because the director was probably working under a penurious budget breakneck time constraints and the best actors he could find for the money heaven knows how future generations will judge facile crap like the cave wrong turn or the remake of house of wax  years from now i hope they are charitable towards our own tastes in supporting our generations wastes of film stock
