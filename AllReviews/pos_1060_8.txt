POS personally i dont like a lot of bw movies but theres something magical about this movie br br the movie starts with elizabeth lane barbara stanwyck liz writes a magazine column about how shes the martha stewart of connecticut of course shes lying this becomes a problem when her publisher mr yardley asks her to play host to a navy sailor over christmas in addition mr yardley whos going to be alone for christmas invites himself up to the farm for the christmas party from there things just go crazybr br since the movie is set on a new england farm the movie has a warm holiday feeling plus the characters are hilarious mr yardley is always shouting orders and lizs friend felix is always yelling catastroph when things go wrong finally the movie ends the way a christmas movie should end a jolly fat man laughs and shouts what a christmas br br in short no matter what age you are you will love this movie
