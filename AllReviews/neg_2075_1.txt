NEG this movie has been promoting in everywhere in spain with a huge publicity campaign after watching it you realise that someone has stolen your money paz vega is horrible as carmen shes not natural at all and she looks like shes making a fashion magazine cover in all the shots the best is when she as an andalusian woman can speak basque and fluently leonardo sbaraglia is much better than her as jose but the story is very slow the plot dont work and the screenplay is really very very badi think penelope cruz the film was written for herwould have been a much more credible and sexy carmenbr br what a waste of time and money
