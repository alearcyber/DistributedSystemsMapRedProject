NEG i loved the original ph and was somewhat satisfied with bloodwings iiand ashes to ashes iii then i saw part iv oh boy as a pumpkinghead enthusiast i did my best to give part  as much credit as i could but its pretty bad the wedding reception fight right at the beginning of the film is a horrendous mess for one thing the hatfield and mccoy storyline is incomprehensibly stupid and clich how did the producers get away with using that tired family feud storyline wow unbelievable the acting besides henrickson is below average the plot and script are mindnumbing the actual editing and cinematography are average as is the directing i mean the movie isnt a total loss as always i really enjoy watching pumpkinhead i love seeing haggis the witch and like watching harleys ghost in action but all three characters had way too much screen time i thought haggis and harley would wind up going out to a supper club for an evening bite to eat and drinks the way the were being so buddy buddy in her cabin the bottom line is is that i wanted all the characters in this puke fest of a plot line to be dead within  minutes of the start of the picture where does scifi get these so called film production professionals from anyway i could do a better job writing a script stone cold drunk im sure there was a limited budget and everything but come on see it if your a fan of the other three but just once and then go back and stick to the original two shame on you scifi
