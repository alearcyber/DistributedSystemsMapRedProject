POS a film first and foremost should be good storytelling it should be entertaining  and entertaining doesnt necessarily mean laughs and it doesnt necessarily mean light it basically means youre not bored while watching it br br as brilliant as  may be it is a difficult film to watch especially for the current videogameplayingipod fumbling generation its slow pace and the sometimes intolerable amount of time it takes for an actor to perform a single action eg the attempt to rescue the crew member floating in space will stretch your patience on the other hand the cinematography is brilliant the film cleverly directed the ending thoughtprovoking and the scorethe score is chilling especially as the crew in the transporter approaches the artifact on the moon boy i had goose bumps big time this doesnt happen often when i watch films and is a testament to kubricks directing skills br br it is considered a classic and many people consider it the best sciencefiction film of all time that alone is a good reason to watch it if you havent done so yet however just because everybody else thinks its a brilliant film doesnt mean you have to force yourself to like it you either will like it or you wont perhaps the slow pace isnt such a bad thing after all directing your attention to something rather static and slowpaced for   hours might teach you a lesson it will certainly be a different experience to all these fastmoving fastpaced images we are subjected to these days whether commercials music videos or video games br br i myself think its a memorable film but not one im eager to watch again anytime soon unless im in a particular mood for slowpaced films br br hence  stars out of  from me
