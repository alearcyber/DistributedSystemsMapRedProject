NEG ok so iam chilling in my room when mom knocks on the door i open the door and what do i see in her hands sleepy hollow high i thinking it has to be an older horror movie because theres noway anyone could be stupid enough to name a movie that after the blockbuster hit sleepy hollow starring johnny depp but to my surprise the movie is at least two years older then the original that alone should have stopped me from putting it into the vcr but no i had to take a chance i had to believe that this movie could have one small ray of hope little did i know that the rays where no where to be seenbr br number one the story line is so ridiculous that its probably true in some country bumpkin town two the actors seem more like people real life people who just happen to wonder on the set when the director yell cut three just about any movie starring the director is always awful but the funny thing is that this is yet another movie directed by kevin summerfield ive become to rely on his movie to bring me to the floor with side splitting laughterbr br where to start on this movie i know lets start with the jogger in the woods the camera lighting was so bad that i lead to believe that the jogger was standing still and the camera man was running i love how the womans stop to eat a candy bar i mean its just about dark or just about light who could tell with the camera lighting and she stops running to eat a candy bar i mean a candy bar what the hell so she ends up being the first victim because of stupidity and already iam ready to break the tape find the director burn his little handsbr br then out of nowhere some guys like trying to fix a car that probably been broken for some years now then in come the fake mack  and a very real prostitute who happen to be part of our main charter castbr br the some of the movie is about a group of kids who all get into trouble and are given the choice to pick up trash in the sleepy hollow park or face suspension forever there sent in the woods with one of the teachersmre or aka kevin summfield who suppose to watch over them and make sure that all goes accordingly the funniest thing is how undeveloped the charters really are i mean what is with the fake mack  dude and whos ever heard of hacker trying to kill themselves and some how one of the students has had an affair with the teacher mr e before all of this community service crap had even came up yet the school still thought it was a cool idea for them to let him go also theres one student named j who purpose in the movie is to keep annoyingly popping up out of no where trying to make the audience jump when all he really does is add to the cheapness of the film the sound was so horrible in this movie i mean there was one seen when two guys are fighting and the guy punches the other guy in the stomach and out of the tv comes this sound effect that sounds like someone punching a stale wooden box it began horribly and ended dangerously stupid even my taste i will say this though the music in the back ground made the scenes look some what tolerable but not that much tolerable my conclusion is this if you want to left at yet another movie that kevin summfield took serious buy sleepy hollow highbr br ps iam still thinking about shooting myself to remove those images of the fake mack  ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
