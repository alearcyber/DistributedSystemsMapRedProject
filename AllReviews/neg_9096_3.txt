NEG gordon goes over the top in typical full moon fashion but thats to be expected combs is surprisingly lowkey keeping his performance at a more realistic level than we are used to seeing also gone is the usual stuart gordon tongueincheek black humorbr br the film is quite effective in showing combs break down and his final heroic act to save his wife  daughter you actually feel sympathy for his character despite his shortcomingsbr br personally i was more surprised at the nudity and borderline porno sex scene than i was shocked by the graphic violence  gorebr br not classic gordon but certainly something you might enjoy if youve seen his more famous films
