NEG i am coming out fighting here because this film was so well shot and so well cast that i am twice as angry about its deevolution than i would have been with a lesser work without revealing too much of the plot i can only say that part one of my  vhs set was an unnerving unfolding delight of bizarre but plausible plot developments the lead character was suitably naiflike but also intelligent and very very open the events that he is rapidly forced to come to terms with are the separation of his parents the culture shock when his pakistani roots collide with a complete breakdown of english straitlaced society in the sixties his fathers dubious transformation into the revered buddha of suburbia and the turning of his cousin into a feminist militant as his best friend suddenly becomes an icon of the burgeoning punk movement in the seventies among other thingsbr br what made me so angry was the amount of detailed work each actor put into creating and establishing their characters in the first part only to have the whole thing devolve into very bad porn episodes in the second part far too many to justify plot development and far too explicit to even seem erotic my biggest pet peeve is when directors let their private fetishes interfere with the truth of their movie and this to me was a supreme examplebr br i felt a bit like id been invited to a party of very clever funny strangers only to have the doors locked and the guests not allowed to interact and all of us forced to watch bad seventies sexploitation films instead what an insult to the hard work of these amazing actors why not just make a cheeseball flick to begin with and why cast a great lead character who can actually act and then cut away from him whenever he is building up to a great performance i almost felt as if he too was growing tired of the endless sex scenes where all he did was lie there pumping his pelvis for yet another breathy naked actressbr br bottom line  part one is minor genius part two is second tier soap opera perversion i know the book is quite explicit but i felt that these fine actors were as exploited in real life as their characters were in the movie and it made me quite angry and very uncomfortable only john waters can pull off such a dubious degrading of actors and plot and have it seem artistic my suggestion is to only watch the first part toss the second in the proverbial rubbish heap and you will love the buddha forever score af
