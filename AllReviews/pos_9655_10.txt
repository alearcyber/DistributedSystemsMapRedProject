POS this is a great movie a must own i really liked every aspect of it from the sword fighting the romance the costumes were really well done and put together the scenery is absolutely beautiful i also loved the mystery and magic also the message of the power of love that love is the greatest power there is i really like the heart of the king in the sense that he desires peace instead of the bloodshed and hate i wish that i could live in a world like that with flying ships to castles in the sky i also think that it was really nice how they brought the animals into the movie i also thought that the cook was really funny i have watched it many times in one day and still never tire of it just wish they would bring it onto a dvd
