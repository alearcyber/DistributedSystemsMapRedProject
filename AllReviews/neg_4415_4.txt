NEG there are a number of movies that my high school friends and i used to joke about they are mostly the campy works of the s that showed up on television on the late show this was one of our favorites the soul of a fallen native being brought to life in a tree stump with a scowl on its face now my friends claimed that if you looked carefully you could see the thing had shoes i never saw this what is most striking to me is that the natives seemed to be white men with black grease paint on their faces some looked sort of italian they also spoke with the strangest timbre that didnt seem to fit their situation like the mummy movies the mobility of the thing didnt seem to offer much of a threat in a confrontation one should only have to walk fast i guess its the old element of surprise if you see this dont take it too seriously be happy that we have a battery of old horror movies that gave us such joy
