POS mild spoilersbr br and thats top ten of all time i stumbled across two hands by accident maybe that made it all the more special  no inflated expectations on ifc one night and couldnt believe that i hadnt heard anything about it now that heath ledger is getting more famous in the usa im sure its more available at the time i was telling friends about the film and no one could find it anywhere except the occasional ifc showingbr br anyway in the blackcomedygangster genre it fits in well with my other favorites and everybody in the film really seems to end up with what they deserve bryan brown is hilarious as the main gangster who makes origami with his small son and plays scrabble with his henchmen also hilarious is the quickedit fate of a random car thief even heath was pretty good in it at the time i vaguely remembered him from a shortlived series on fox called roar hopefully gregor jordan will make another hit but as far as im concerned this is his best yet
