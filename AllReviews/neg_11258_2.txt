NEG i have to be honest and admit that this movie did basically nothing for me except baffle me completely its burdened with a plot that revolves around the mysterious murders of several young women which then gets linked to the discovery of a body over  years old the story never really seems to make much sense especially when robicheaux played by tommy lee jones starts having his conversations with confederate general john bell hood i never really did figure that out jones was ok in his role although i thought he was really starting to show his age here horribly miscast was john goodman as julie baby feet balboni who i guess is supposed to be some sort of local mob figure i simply didnt think goodman worked in this role although ill admit that just could be because im not much of a john goodman fan somewhere in the mix appeared justina machado as an fbi agent although i never really did understand what the fbi was involved in which could mean simply that my attention kept wandering from the screen if it was explained though i missed it completely fortunately this is a fairly short movie so you wont waste too much of your life on it
