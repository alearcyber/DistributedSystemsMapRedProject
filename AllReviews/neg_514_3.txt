NEG pun intended this low budget actionhorror vehicle for don wilsons ability to kick things is the stuff directtovideo fare is made ofbr br the plot wilson is a humorless vampire hunter who comes under fire from local law enforcement after he is forced to slaughter creatures of the night in view of the public police chase him vampires chase him he responds by kickinga lotbr br there is a little more to the story but it is so inconsequential that i honestly cant remember it i think people actually spoke in the movie but thats up to debate the plot is nothing more than a setup for wilson to kill as many vampires as possible in the running time usually by kicking thembr br the technical specs are in a word anemic little color treating amateurish use of lighting simplistic use of camera and angle blood and gore is noticeably limited odd for this type of film the most hurtful of the filming foulups is the jarring shift to supershaky cam during each and every fight scene if the camera begins to bounce around like a reese monkey on speed then you know don is about to start kicking everything in sightbr br all in all this is the kind of bad movie that can be made good with a few friends and a lot of cynical humor otherwise do not watch unless you really like to watch things get kickedbr br
