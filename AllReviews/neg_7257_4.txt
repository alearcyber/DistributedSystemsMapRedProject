NEG i got hold of a discount copy of this i had seen it several years ago my only recent experience had been mystery science theatre where it was soundly spoofed one never really gets a chance to get into these movies because of all the byplay i love the beginnings of fifties horror movies they give us a pompous lecture on the defense systems near the arctic these were there to protect us from the expected soviet invasion but they should come in handy given the threat of very large insects br br this particular one flies for some reason despite its exoskeleton made of the stuff grasshoppers are made of they can still fend off air to air missiles and disable fighter planes br br anyway its more funfirst the obligatory deranged case who saw the flying thing cooling his heels in a hospital it just teaches onesee an insect as big as a housekeep your mouth shut i wonder if the poor guy got to go home after they found the bugbr br otherwise this is a pretty ordinary effort it follows the usual efforts to come up with a way of dissuading the stubborn bugand leaves us open to other possibilitiesthe russians next time i still get a kick out of these films and this one is serviceable
