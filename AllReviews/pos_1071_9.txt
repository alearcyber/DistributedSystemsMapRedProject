POS first i loved the documentary it represents a new school historytheory where a subject can reflect a wide range of social and historical issuesbr br ill get the camera and dogs out of the way first i hate the blair witch quality of the camera but also understand the advantage of such a casual approach in fact i agree with the other reviewer that it gives us unprecedented accessbr br dogs warning i have a doctoral degree in literature which i do not use as a profession so some of my training may seep in the dogs are a beautiful metaphor for the complex relationship of humans great endeavors and our need to find the labor to achieve them the dogs might reflect their owners as one reviewer suggested but they also serve as a standin for the workers we see in the film while this might hint at the marxist problem raised by one reviewer i think it also shows how difficult it is to globalize labor issues no mondovis in italy may not translate as well elsewhere yikes i am a marxist at heart and hate to hear my cynical resignation hold sway it is a remarkable bait and switch the dogs are family the workers are family but in the end the dogs are the workers the last scene with the poor farmer while you may disagree with the politics the artistry of the analogy coupled with the more overt politics of the film are wonderfulbr br had only faulkner i am from alabama had the power of film beyond the hollywood market what interesting tales would have been told
