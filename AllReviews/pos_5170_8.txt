POS just watched it on the hallmark channel i was surprised to john denver this movie was full of clichs but that is to be expected a made for tv christmas movie come on the acting is as good as any other s made for tv movie the story is as i said before predictable and clich but still good if you are looking for a campy christmas movie it will certainly scratch your itchbr br i was also pleased when i learned that it took place in georgetown colorado it is a real mountain town west of denver very cool as this is my home regionbr br i was never a big john denver fan i always found him to be pretty foney but he was a decent actor he is very good as the good old boy like he played in this filmbr br if you get the chance to watch it than do im sure it will be on again in
