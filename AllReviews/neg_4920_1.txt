NEG well at least this was the last sequel that i could find at blockbuster because this movie was just downright horrible i mean i can understand how hard it would be to get rid of an evil house were talking starting a horrible fire bulldozing flood etc but a mirror how hard could it be can it be to get rid of a mirror this was the most horrible movie that couldve put the title of amityville into the picture br br well a group of friends who are pretty much from the start are a bunch of freaks one of them is a photographer of some kind and buys a haunted mirror from a homeless creepy guy teaching me a valuable lesson dont buy things from homeless creepy guy of course the horrible deaths and chaos ensues this group though i cant imagine anyone missing thembr br please skip amityville a new generation ive already got a few complaints about my generation so i think this was a premonition not to sound so crazy p but believe me this is horribly acted not well thought out and not even scary i feel so bad for the original writers of the amityville horror they must be crying every time person witnesses this filmbr br
