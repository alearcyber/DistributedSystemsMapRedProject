POS despite the apparent structural similarity with the simpsons  loud fat dad housewifey mum  children a pet typical suburban home family guy is actually functionally and stylistically opposite to the simpsons its avid use and sometimes too much of cutaway gags has been its main stay since the first season while some hit the nail on the head the rhea perlman and danny devito bit in season  is spinesnappingly hilarious others are less successful coming across as contrived and they can be annoying especially when they dont advance the story line the jesus bits are entirely unfunny and insultingbr br the chemistry between stewie and brian griffin lends itself to pure comedy gold so much so that chris and meg only manage to fulfill the role of the obligatory teenagers in your typical dysfunctional familybr br however the feature film stewie griffin the untold story is mindnumbingly horrible thank goodness it went straight to dvdbr br contrary to tiresome comparisons with the perennial simpsons seth macfarlanes approach with family guy is actually very different  its much more politically incorrect and amazingly a lot more brazenbr br creator of ren and stimpy john kricfalusi famously criticized family guy for having extremely low graphic standards from a cartoonists standpoint i dont think it looks that bad though the detailing and accuracy of some of the spoofs are quite successfulbr br all in all a great series to go with a great big bowl of chips smothered in ranch sauce and ass jokes
