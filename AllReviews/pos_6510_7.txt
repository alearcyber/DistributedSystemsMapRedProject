POS okay i think were all agreed that michael jackson was the low pointbr br and the special effects too but please keep in mind that this was not a bigbudget film okay not every film gets as much of a budget as harry potter or star warsbr br however i thought it was pretty funny altogether b nothing that would in my opinion waste your timebr br parodies are always fun to watch and just because it wasnt big budget doesnt mean its badbr br i think this was a good movie if weak at some pointsbr br hope this comment helps angela
