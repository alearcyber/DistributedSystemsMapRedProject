NEG being a fan of zasu pitts comedies i thought this one looked like it was worth a try i was quite disappointedbr br the version i saw was on tcm but consisted only of the niagara falls movie the miss polly movie was absent the talents of the actors who give fine performances is wasted on one of the stupidest stories i have ever had the misfortune of sitting throughbr br tom brown tom wilson surprised me by being the strongest actor in the show but the spotlight is hogged by slim summerville sam sawyer who if he has any talent didnt demonstrate it herebr br zasu pitts elly sawyer is great but doesnt have near big enough a part the biggest laugh in the movie is when she ends up under sam under a tablebr br the only one in the movie who has any sense at all is tom wilson margie marjorie woodworth is unreasonable in general while she is physically quite attractive her personality and attitudes make her completely undesirable elly sam and the hotel desk clerk are just complete foolsbr br sam and elly give up their honeymoon suite in the crowded hotel for tom and margie but then they take it back sam ends up imprisoning tom and margie in their room most of the movie is them trying to break out but sam using a rifle always puts them back againbr br towards the end comes the worst part tom who is finally about to make good his escape runs into a minister on a lower floor of the hotel now the guy who as i said is the only one in the whole movie who has a head on his shoulders suddenly for absolutely no reason at all decides he has to marry margiebr br he drags the minister up to the room he has just escaped from but margie doesnt want to marry him he gives her a kiss and now after one kiss she feels compelled to marry himbr br finally sam has the nerve to say to tom you deceived me when practically the only line tom had to sam earlier was were not married to which sam replied you think id believe that br br idiotic
