POS this is not a film to impress you with high budget hightech shots fast camera movements or glimmering costumes thought by an overzealous and hungry director but its a film by a director who is also a very good photographer who has a very good sense of looking at things as a human not as an halfgod unlike most of the directors this is not a film in which actors and actresses try to give their best performances with unreal or at best learned gestures and mimics rather its a film in which they act as real as it can be actually they are not professional actors at all the dialogues between the main characters their expressions their feelings are as real as they can easily be yours in real life you tell the same lies to the people around you with the same regrets that you avoid to express with words you show the same signs of nuisance to an unwanted guest this is the same feeling of disconnection that you get in modern city life and this is your chance to see yourself from outside impersonated by the main characters i saw all of the films of nuri bilge ceylan incl his short film koza cacoon thanks to those who puts it in the dvd many would compare him with tarkovsky ozu and maybe bresson or bergman as he is emerging as a true auteur and he is sincere in saying that his films are not to make money but to give a meaning to his life that is the kind of sincerity youll find in uzak
