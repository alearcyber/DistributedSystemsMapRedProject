POS what i liked best about this featurelength animated film from  is the great feel it gives for the early s its the songs the clothing automobiles buildings lingo of the day etc you feel like youve stepped back into timebr br from reading some of the reviews here i see this was a hardluck film being released a couple of days before the pearl harbor attack wow no one would be interested in going to the movies for a featurelength cartoon during those eventful and shocking days im sure too bad because the folks missed some nice animation would have really impressed back then almost  years ago the colors are nice drawings are good and story involving as we root for the bugs led by hoppity and and his beautiful girl honey to make it happilyeverafter and out of harms way its also about all of them finding a grassy spot they can live and not worry about humans trampling thembr br there is a nasty villain though  c bagley beetle  and two of his henchmen those helpers swat the fly and smack the mosquito are comedians complete with their brooklynese accents the story is a familiar one where a nasty old man wants to marry the sweet young thing and uses unscrupulous means to force her hand the good guy meanwhile has the decked stacked against him but in the very end of course prevailsbr br my favorite part  this will sound worse than what it was  was when goodguy hoppity got temporarily electrocuted and he danced in blackandwhite that was fantastic animation br br you know its a good thing i didnt see this as a very little kid i would have been afraid to play outside and squash all those nice bugpeople you never know what or who is in that grass beneath your feet
