NEG this movie is not worth a descend review it just made me decide that i am not going to go see the next tarantino film and i used to love tarantinos filmsbr br not artsy not entertaining not witty not funny nothing just dull and stupid if this movie would have been tarantinos first it would have also been his lastbr br tarantino has to get a grip on himself otherwise his next movie is going to be  hours of meaningless boring and uncool dialog it seems like he has fallen in love with his dialog  and his love is blindbr br after you finish your popcorns theres no reason to sit in a theater anymore
