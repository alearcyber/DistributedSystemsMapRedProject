POS the story was well plotted and interesting by itself however it is difficult for me to write the review of this film without spoiling you to avoid that i am not going to talking the story herebr br i regard this film as a good adaption of sarah waters book as compared with the previous one tipping the velvet i read the book first and then watched the dvd later the film did retain most of spirits of the main characters in the book of course due to the time limitation the film in the last  min seemed to be in a rush to cover the part iii of the book therefore it couldnt illustrate well the scene when they all met in the the kitchen of mr ibbss place and those after that even the book seemed to me to be a rush on that kitchen scene despite that the film actually did a good job in representing the story it really worth watching its still unclear when bbcamerica can broadcast this film thats pitybr br ps noticed that the ages of maud and sue were set to be  instead of  in the book the latter is more reasonable while the former is more close to the ages of actresses
