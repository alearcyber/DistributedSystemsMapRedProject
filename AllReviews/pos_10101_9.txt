POS this isnt so much a review of a tale of two sisters as it is a discussion of some of the smaller plot details so i advise you not to read this review if you havent seen the film because doing so will absolutely ruin a few surprises for youbr br in a way a tale of two sisters is far from original at least from a purely superficial aspect  some of its iconography is taken straight from ring or dark water while the storyline itself especially what brendt sponseller calls the rubber reality aspect of the narrative is reminiscent of films like fight club lead character interacts with someone created in their mind mulholland drive character creates alternate reality in a psychogenic fugue as well as other minor aspects of lost highway jacobs ladder and basically every film under the sun dealing with mental illness plus amenabars films the others abre los ojos memento particularly with regards to the torturous nature of memory et al thankfully all these similarities do not detract from the films overall emotional impact and i personally found a tale of two sisters an extremely moving and rewarding experiencebr br many people have commented on the confusing nature of the narrative but i personally found the storyline to be fairly selfexplanatory even if it is in part portrayed in a nonsequential manner the narrative only becomes confusing for some because midway through the final third the story switches from a purely subjective setting ie soomis warped perception of reality to an objective one with a flashback at the end explaining the origins of soomis nervous breakdown and subsequent mental illness the shift in emphasis is bound to throw some people off guard but structurally i found it somewhat reminiscent of aforementioned mulholland drive even though were not dealing with a characters perception of reality via a dream but instead their own schizophrenic tendencies  something which in turn reminded me of another lynch movie lost highway to be honest i dont really regard a tale of two sisters as a horror movie as such but rather a tragic story of a familys breakdown as well as an honest look at a characters mental illness and i hasten to add that fans of psychoanalytical cinema are going to love this filmbr br that aside the cinematography in a tale of two sisters is incredible and visually this is one of the most beautiful films ive seen this side of wong kar wais  the performances are also fantastic without exception and i expect to see more of the four lead actors in the future not to mention the music but then east asian films without a great soundtrack seem to be few and far between these daysbr br its very likely that some people will look past the finer artistic points of a tale of two sisters and simply dismiss it as yet another asian horror film oblivious to its aesthetic beauty and honest psychoanalytical approach but then each to their own if you can ignore some of the films platitudinous aspects and simply take it for what it is at heart ie an extremely tragic heartbreaking story then i see no reason not to recommend it
