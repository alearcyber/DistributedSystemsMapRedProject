POS it was sad that committed lasted only two weeks in dallas theaters i thought this movie had a lot going for it the script was funny full of subtle emotional shifts and it had a good message the acting was great everyone did a superb job especially with the scripts subtleties heather graham not only has beautiful eyes she has expressive eyes for that matter all the actors were attractive why it didnt do well in its theatrical release i dont knowother than the studio didnt seem to have much of a push behind it but it deserved to do better and i hope it does well on video its certainly one of my favorites for the first half of
