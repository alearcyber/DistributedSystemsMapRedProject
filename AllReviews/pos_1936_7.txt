POS this relic from before the days of the production code and the hays office is good fun not great but entertainingbr br based on a song by rogers  hart that was an enormous hit at the time the story revolves around dance hall girl barbara stanwyck who is romanced by wealthy businessman ricardo cortez who was indecently handsome but whose heart belongs to her bookish neighbor monroe owsley she and owsley marry but keep it a secret while she dismisses cortez who still holds out hope she helps hubby get a job in cortezs company but married bliss quickly turns sour as owsley develops a taste for the high life and steps out with a college sweetheart and gambles in highstakes bridge yup i know its pretty funny finally he embezzles  from cortez and is about to go on the lam when his devoted wife goes to cortezand i wont reveal anything else although the ending was certainly a surprisebr br stanwyck is the best thing about this movie in one of her earliest roles shes quite accomplished owsley is the weak point hes unattractive and sniveling while cortez is amazingly suave and sexy while his performance is earnest but unremarkablebr br while ostensibly a drama its filled with laughs many inadvertant as some elements of this movie have aged very poorly but there are a lot of good witty lines at one point stanwyck says to cortez my brains are in my feet while yours are in thats pretty darn suggestive for  theres a lot of bawdy and suggestive stuff in this flick in the last days before the code clamped down and whitewashed everything an amusing antique a good reminder of how far we havent come in  yearsthis story could very easily be changed to fit  but could keep the basic plot with the original ending in place
