NEG i mean really really really high and this movie has a shot at entertainment i dont mean regular high i mean the high where reading the phonebook would have you in stitches otherwise save the time out of your life and go do something more constructive with it like hitting your head on a brick wall and insulting your own intelligence a complete waste of talent in some cases bernie mac john c mcginley tom kenny and the master of hams shatner and exactly the kind of crap they deserve to make the myriad of rappers who insist on making movies not without its laughs again chemical aid is crucial and certainly not without offending the politically oversensitive which im always in favor of but ultimately not worth the time out of your life
