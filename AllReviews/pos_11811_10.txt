POS this was such a beautiful film such an amazing performance from joseph and brad very innocently written and performed a must see  i cried my eyes out almost through the entire movie this is a movie that every family should sit down with their children to watch it does teach us all a very important lesson in life and how we should be approaching the harsh subject of aids how we should be teaching our children to cope with it and people around them not only with aids but with any terminal illness i hadnt even heard of this movie until i scrolled through tv one day and happen to run across it i recommend everyone to watch this just dont forget your box of tissues more movies should be made like this one extremely heartwarming
