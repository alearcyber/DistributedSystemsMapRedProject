NEG i have recently found this film on one of my husbands vhs tapes the blank variety which he uses to record stuff from the telly the film looks as if it was last shown in the eighties and i dont remember having seen it since it has not to my knowledge been released on dvd or vhs although i shall browse around for a copybr br the film tells the story of three young people two girls one on the edge of puberty and the other much younger and a young boy who go to live with their mothers brother and his young mute irish wife his wife also has two brothers who live with them the childrens uncle is an unpleasant control freak who forces his young wife to wear a silver collar whilst she watches a marionette show put on by him and her brothers in his toyshopbr br the eldest girl and one of the irishmen the younger develop a love for each other whilst they live in the same house the girl helps her aunt out in the shop whilst her brother helps his uncle to make things in the workshopbr br there are a lot of very disturbing elements to the film there is the uncles treatment of his wife as some kind of dumb literally possession illustrated by the collar whilst the irish indulge dancing drinking and somewhat forbidden love interestingly though i have seen far more explicit themes played out in other movies made in hollywood todaybr br makes you wonder whether the british film industry and the bbc have some kind of hidden agenda going onbr br still despite it not being a childrens movie there are a lot of playful magic moments in it and the one irishman does some beautiful paintings
