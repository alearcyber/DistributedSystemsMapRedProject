POS kevin spacey again picks a winner with kpax an endearing movie that expresses profound revelations at human existence via the prot characters naive yet at the same time unquestionably wise point of viewbr br its enjoyable trying to work out if he is or he isnt as the plot expands and the robert porter character gets fleshed out however some may find the ending a little unsatisfying but in reality it couldnt have been any other waybr br my few issues with the film revolve around the rather cartoony and over simplified portrayal of mental patients i was surprised because the films plot shows a great deal of intelligence and i dont feel it would have lost anything by being more honest regarding how people with mental health problems behavebr br that said i realise this was a movie and not a documentary and the film itself is exquisitly shot and the story unwraps at a pleasing rate br br bridges is great and spacey delivers a languid and relaxed performance more like a standup than an alienbr br a good film that will get you talking with your friends
