POS as a lategoing patron of the drivein thearers ss there are many movies that i have seen  forgotten this is one i could never forget despite its lowbudget exploitationstyle of moviemaking the story was very well done the isolated therapyasylum where patients act out their fantasies in order to help cure their phsycosis the accidental murder of the head doctor just as the new nurse arrives on the scene the supposed assistant doctor taking over the various crazy paitents the revelation that the assistant doctor is actually a patient herself and finally the rescue of the young nurse by the simpleminded sam who killed everyone else in the house so she could escape unharmed made for a great story which held the film together i emphasised the word story because thats what makes a good or great film no matter how much blood gore nudity sexual matter or outrageous behaviour you put in a film if the story is not good then the film is not good the film credits show clips of all the actors including the old hag with the final line telling you to get out  never come back which is a great ending to this film if it is out on videodvd see it  enjoy it
