POS i caught this movie late night on tv and was expecting a lowbudget campy masterpiece i was surprised with a pretty decent movie angelina jolies unique acting capabilities or should i say lack thereof make her perfect as an android and the other actors while terribly average are at least not terriblebr br there is a plot a fairly intricate plot at that involving conspiracies and the lengths a couple one human one android will go to pursue their illegal romance with a big brothertype figure and android assassin thrown in the mix the production and sets also were much better than i expected i havent seen the original cyborg so i cant really compare it to much else granted this film is no blade runner but as a latenight futuristic guilty pleasure its worth a watch
