POS just thinking about the movie i laugh to myself anne ramsey plays an unforgettable part as momma probably the most nasty yet hilarious matriarch ever captured on film danny devito and billy crystal make a fabulous duo bringing a true warmth to the film though not exceedingly complex the cute story holds your attention and keeps you laughing the whole way through its a fun comedy to lighten things up and even will entertain the kids i give it my full recommendation
