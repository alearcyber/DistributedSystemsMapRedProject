NEG after consuming human pork chop and properly digesting it i felt urged and obliged to inform potential viewers that chewing on this product is no fun and its substance of low nutritive valuebr br according to the dull nature of this film the following is gonna be a warning more than a review this is the first time i wished that there is an idontcaretoratethismoviebutton on imdb because the only reaction to this boring piece of trash is stasis and indifference every possible rating would do injustice to all the other items listed here a  is out of question anyway  might persuade some readers that this is one of those cases where its so bad that its actually really bad and thats kewl and  is unsatisfying as well people might think that its an okflick and alright if you wanna have some cheesy fun which it is not honest to god its neither a  a zero nor a  its nothing a black hole a futile work conceived by an embryo i bought the region  dvd which was cheap  bucks at least and of good picturequality i bought it mainly because of the positive and promising reviews posted below my own entry oh boy was i to be disappointed this movie is neither shocking nor disgusting nor unnerving nor its not even laughable it doesnt take itself too serious to be laughed at but still serious enough so as not to be comic a truly unpassionate amateurish effort the only sequence that i found mildly disturbing is when two giggling thugs put an ugly dog in a bag and bash it against a brick wall but even such a cruel premise only lead to a poor execution the further down cited toilet scene is unrealistic and filmmed without any sense for suspense suffering or humiliation  the feces look like painted marshmellows there is a butchery scene at the end of a loooong minutes where three men dressed in plastic raincoats a setup which one finds also depicted on the front cover of the dvd start to dispose of the female body reminded me of american psycho and shallow grave now these flicks are worth watching and true masterpiecesbr br lets be realistic for once and not rush to make a myth out of every asianwannabescarymovie as seems to happen latelybr br if you are looking out for some eastern horror then try danny lees masterpiece of the very same english title ba xian fan dian zhi ren rou cha shao bao human pork chop its from  and has  not without reason i might add  been compared to henry portrait of a serial killer there is also a similar film telling the same story by a different film crew called ren tou dou fu shang there is a secret in my soup of the same year sort of a rival production its available as a region  dvd and by most regarded as superior to peng shi zhi sang jin tian liang i might add a few more words on the special effects what special effects there are a few chopped off limbs they look awful  in a wrong sense  probably made in hong kongbr br thats about all the info i can share on this subject hopefully it will prove helpful enjoy your meal
