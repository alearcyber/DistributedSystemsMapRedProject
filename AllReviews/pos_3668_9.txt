POS unconditional love is surprisingly entertaining while the plot goes off in perhaps too many directions making for an overlong movie it never fails to charm and ingratiate itself the several plotlines one warmly reminiscent of shirley valentine provide ample smiles laughs wisdom and tenderness it all shouldnt work and at times it certainly bumps along but forgive its inconsistencies sit back and have a good time its a charmer
