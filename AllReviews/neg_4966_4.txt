NEG i was only cautiously enthusiast when renting all the boys love mandy lane as i instantly remembered hearing  reading a wide variety of opinions  both positive and negative  in the short period of time between its brief cinematic release and the distribution towards videostore shelves supposedly this was the most ingenious and refreshing new horror film in years with nonstereotypical teen characters and unpredictable plot twists for a change okay the basic concept may perhaps sound reasonably innovative but inevitably the screenplay quickly reverts to the same old and irritating slasher clichs and once passed that point even the nifty stylistic trademarks cant save the film from dreadful mediocrity the opening sequences are indeed terrific and literally bath in a moodily melancholic ambiance which actually makes it all the more painful to witness the film sink towards the ordinary level of rudimentary slasher flick after the sublime intro showcasing a drunk macho kid miscalculate his jump off a rooftop in order to impress the titular beauty all the boys love mandy lane turns out to be just another textbook and uninspired horror movie about a bunch of idiotic kids getting stoned and horny on a secluded ranch before getting killed off by a notsounidentified maniac the films entire pretentious setup collapses faster than a ramshackle house of cards we never get a proper explanation why mandy herself behaves so frigid and haughty towards all her admirers because she grew up an orphan perhaps oh boohoo the boys soon enough illustrate theyd settle for sex with any random bimbo and not exclusively with the divine mandy and the final twist  albeit undeniably offbeat  is just plain senseless the middle section of is rather boring and doesnt even offer any genuinely horrific excitement shotgun killings please or authentic rancid sleaze my generous rating  out of  entirely goes to the grainy and unsettling s filming style with faded colors bizarre but beautiful photographic images and the surprisingly marvelous soundtrack director jonathan levine opted for the classic bobby vinton song sealed with a kiss to play during the trailer and endcredits whereas i initially was convinced the film would inevitably feature barry manilows cheesy lovesong mandy
