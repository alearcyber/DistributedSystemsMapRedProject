POS first of all  you should watch this only if you dont mind the lack of subtitles  pornography  kinky sex and utter  horrifying and truly shocking depravity  i mentioned kinky sex  but to call sex in the second half of the movie  kinky  would be a great understatement  its more like a punch in the face if you arent prepared for this sort of sickness  that being said  i can go back to reviewing this morbid piece of pseudo  snuff genre brought to us by our fellow japanese br br the plot seems to be fairly basic  almost nonexistent  a girl is hired to perform in amateur porn movie  dont expect much in first    minutes  there is some dialog  if you dont speak japanese its not going to mean much to you  that seems to be an occasional chatting between the girl and the crew  performer  then there is some porn  straight sex   and after the scene is finished the performers and the crew take a break  and then  it starts to happen br br it seems that the girl is talked into performing one more scene  this time tied with the rope  the abuse begins  whipping  slapping  hot wax  in the end  girl breaks down and cries  they untie her br br then we see performers and crew sitting at the table as if nothing had happened  except for the girl  she is visibly shaken and looks like she wants to leave  she walks to the door  sits on the floor to put her shoes on  and thats when hell breaks loose br br she is hit in the head with the baseball bat  her wound is treated  she is tied to the bed  what ensues can be briefly described  im not going to spoil everything for you  as rape during dismemberment  think of  flower of flesh and blood   mix it with porn and you will get the idea it goes on for about  minutes or so  sfx are very good  makeup too  everything is shown  with no mercy for the viewer  you have been warned br br i thought  visitor q  was a very sick movie  after watching  niku daruma  it looked like a fairytale to me this movie is so sick  so depraved  so twisted  so disgusting that the harshest words pale in comparison to its finale  too bad its released only on vhs so there are no subtitles available  but the movie still works without them  so  if you are into ultra sickness  extreme sadism and other beauties of this beloved genre  check this out  i hope you wont have nightmares
