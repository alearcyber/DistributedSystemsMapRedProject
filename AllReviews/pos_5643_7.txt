POS the title is a reference to the destruction of the remnants of a harvest like rice husks by farmers who burn them creating fires on the plains this is a bleak tale of the destruction of the japanese soldierbr br the story is set in the closing days of the philippines campaign as a soldier with tb who returns from a hospital because since he can walk they have no room for him his superior officers dont want him around since hes really too sick to work or fight abused by his officer hes sent back to the hospital with orders to either be admitted or kill himself they still wont take him and hes soon left to wander across the war ravaged landscape trying to find help or a place to stay or even just food its a bleak journey with no hope in sight and only death and mans inhumanity to man at every turnbr br billed as a harrowing journey into the dark heart of man and war this is also a very funny movie this isnt to say its not horrifying it is at times but its also darkly comic how could it not be here is a film where madness and insanity run rampant people are constantly trying to hustle tobacco leaves for food trying to get even a slightly better pair of shoes trying to remain a japanese soldier in the face of absurdity by marching constantly but never getting anywhere and you cant help but laugh to be sure things go darker as it becomes clear that cannibalism maybe literally and figuratively the only way to survive but at the same time there is something uncomfortably funny about the human comedybr br hailed as a great antiwar film its stark photographic style makes clear the insanity of war even as it dazzles our eye with its beauty here we see landscapes full of bodies that include the soldier and the civilian set amid fields forests and trees that would otherwise be and to some extent still are quite beautiful its a jarring sensationbr br what intriguing is that i read that this is based on a novel about the redemptive power of christianity the director removed all over the religious references to hope and salvation and instead used it as to show that life stinks war stinks worse and that there is ultimately no hopebr br intellectually i admire the film emotionally i dont part of it is a strident downbeat score which for me over accentuates what we are seeing on the screen its almost gilding the lily since the imagery is so strong it doesnt really need to have the music force you into feeling one way or anotherbr br is it a great film thats for you to decide for certain its unlike any other war film bloody horrific and real in ways that big budgeted films claim to be but never are this is not for those adverse to blood and gore since its here in spadesbr br definitely worth a look
