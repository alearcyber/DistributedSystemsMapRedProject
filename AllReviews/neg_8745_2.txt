NEG i suppose you could say this film has a grain of potential but nothing more because boy did the filmmakers botch it the plot is practically incomprehensible the pacing is lethargic and the acting is pathetic and what the hell is a trade rat worst of all though this movies climax is the anticlimax of all anticlimaxes plus the title doesnt seem even remotely accurate the only redeeming feature of this film is the pretty darkhaired woman well the blond girl was pretty too but she was annoying and not as good looking as the brunette anyhoo as with a lot of movies this is one to be seen only on mstk
