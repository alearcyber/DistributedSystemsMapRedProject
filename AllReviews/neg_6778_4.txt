NEG this movie describes a truly horrific event to be sure but it all falls down from poor performances from all the cast it is impossible to feel the emotion of almost any character as all the emotional scenes seem like parodies of themselves for example a character is shot at the start of the movie and you get the clichd desperate am i gonna make it sergeant yeah it aint nothing but it plays out like a sketch from a wayans brothers movie i dont know if theyve made the war movie yet or something starring leslie nielsenbr br the sergeant played by sean penn reminds me of al bundy from married with children while fox is the greatest selfdeprecating goodguy clich you can imagine thank god he curses and smokes during itbr br his emotional noooo is definitely more suited to comedies like back to the future than socalled serious movies such as thisbr br to their credit some of the main scenes without giving too much away where they actually perform some fairly horrific acts are well done and do make us take the subject matter seriously but that is in spite of not thanks to the acting
