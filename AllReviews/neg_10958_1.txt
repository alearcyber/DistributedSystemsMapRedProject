NEG new rule nobody is allowed to make any more zombie movies unless they actually come up with an original ideabr br sadly this movie doesnt they have the premise that bounty hunters go out and kill zombies and prove it by cutting off their fingers well problems with that most people have ten fingers why not just collect ten bounties for one zombie why not just kill a regular person and pass that off as a zombie finger br br not to mention the utter silliness of hunting zombies with a bolt action riflebr br i sometimes think films like this are resume fillers for makeup and fx guys hey this is what i did with ten dollars and some recylced bottles deposit imagine what i could do if you gave me a budget do you think anyone goes to drama school or cinema school to star in a zombie movie i went to the school of the arts check me out as the tunnel zombie in quick and the undead his mother must be so proudbr br these had to be the wimpiest zombies ever as a whole crowed of them apparently couldnt push down a wooden door or even break a glass window no they had to wait for the bounty hunter to open the door for them
