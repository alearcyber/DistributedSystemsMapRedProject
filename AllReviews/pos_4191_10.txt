POS this allbutignored masterpiece is about the monkees becoming aware that they are fictional characters in a movie head and that everything they do or say had already been written in an unseen script they seem to be following head was written by jack nicholson rafelson and peter tork during a threeday lsd trip in a suite at an expensive hollywood hotel the other three monkees only acted in itbr br they fight this every way they can by doing things not in the script they deliberately flub their lines walk off sets tear up scenery punch other actors for no reason and ultimately commit suicide by jumping off a bridge br br for instance in the rapid flashes of a psychedelic party scene if you watch framebyframe you can see rafelson sitting next to the camera and cameraman very deliberately shooting into a mirror he is revealing that the party is actually fake and is being shot in a studio with actors who suddenly drop out of character and walk away in the middle of a conversation when the director yells cutbr br the monkees however never drop out of character because those characters are also who they really are that ends up being the core of the revelation soon to comebr br at every turn they realize their increasinglybizarre actions were exactly what they were supposed to do in the scripted film they cant escape being in you say they went crazy and walked through the sky which turns out to be painted on paper and hung from the ceiling as the sets background no problem hey hey theyre the monkees and those wacky guys just keep monkeying around br br in the end even their deaths did not set them free that was how the movie was supposed to end and their motionless waterlogged bodies are fished out of the river put in another box and stacked in a film studio warehouse until the characters are needed again for another studio productionbr br this is made all the more poignant by the fact that the monkees really are fictional characters who forced themselves into the real world they did it through the power of their musicbr br ironically near the end peter tork has what he rightly sees as a hugely profound revelation that solves their problem but unfortunately no one listens br br peter realizes it doesnt matter if were in the box the film he means that it doesnt matter if will is free or illusory and that the only important thing is that you just let the present moment occur and occur you need to just let now happen as it happens without analyzing or evaluating or judging whether the experience is valid by some abstract definitionbr br when you cant even tell the difference will being free or not doesnt mattertying to figure out if you are the real you is just a pointless waste of timebr br i saw this film at a very important time in my life i was trying to figure out how to escape being just that geeky creepy nerd girl by thinking about it intensely instead of just having fun ie sex like everyone else did but the revelation in head broke my selfimposed recursive trap and helped me more than rafelson or nicholson or tork will ever knowbr br for decades ive watched head and wished i could thank petebr br was this a good moviebr br uhh how about likebr br  yes
