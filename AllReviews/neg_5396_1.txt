NEG skeleton man was okay for the first  minutes but as soon as the socalled special force agents hit the screen it went down hill faster than a fat kid on a sledbr br the opening makes us think we might have a corny yet fun horror flick on our hands but nothe film makers ruin any hope of that when the special force agents show up i wish the screenwriter took a different route and had the skeleton man chase down some dim witted teenagers until one of them finally gets the upper hand instead the skeleton man chases down some dim witted special force agents and offs them until their captain finally gets the upper handbr br i know the whole stalking of dim witted teenagers by a killer thing as been done before but it would of been more suited for a movie like thisbr br when the skeleton man finally does meet his so called demise in a building that blows up the captain of the special force agents is asked the following by a police officer outside of the building what the hell happened in there my answer to that question who the hell cares
