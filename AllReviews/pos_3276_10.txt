POS im not the biggest fan of westerns my two personal favorites though are unforgiven and tombstone this movie though i loved it was great the plot was well done and it was a fun movie everybody who had a part in this movie did excellent i even think it beat out both movies in someway well not really unforgiven because that was a superb movie that these two cant compare with in the long run i do think it beat out tombstone though both had its strong points for instance they both had excellent well known casts very good plots and very good filming but posse beat out tombstone in four ways in my opinion first the characters were more unique in posse the music was better in posse the idea was original in posse unlike wyatt earp and the biggest difference the action sequences oh my gosh posse was a western with really good action sequences i mean really good the action was fast paced like modern day based shootem up movies the action had big budget explosions too the fistfights were pretty good also mario van pebbles was great in this movie i suggest buying this excellent movie
