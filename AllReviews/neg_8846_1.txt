NEG forget the lousy acting that can be forgiven in this sort of film or even the terrible unnatural dialog and illogical events if my subtitles actually reflected what was said far worse is the blatant absence of a skillful or experienced director who maybe took a holiday with the editor while the film was being made watching the film it feels completely out of date even though it was only made  years ago a computer virus as a portal to the afterlife lol a dial up internetconnection clucky ghost images photoshopped on pictures he look over thereis thatis that a face zoom in on face oops sound breaks off chop next scene  scenes and sequences are poorly edited and as a result dont flow at all youll be watching a girl finding a corpse still hanging from the knot in one scene and then literally  seconds later seeing her again at some place apparently unaffected smiling and going aboutbr br apart from the many problems i have with the movie in terms of productionvalue it is also painfully long and repetitive and thus utterly boringbr br i recommend shutter in stead an oriental thai horror movie done well
