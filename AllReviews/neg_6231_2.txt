NEG i love most jet li movies with the exception of romeo must die and i bought this movie in a very cheap threepack with the master and twin warriors while twin warriors was very impressive and i was thoroughly intrigued by it and the master was a bit karate kid but also enjoyable i thought this movie was terrible im not just saying that because im used to better movies im saying that it was almost down there with kazaam the fight scenes were terrible blurry cameras and no real fighting and the plot was your typical stupid kungfu plot if you are going to have a plot this stupid see man turns into woman to become allpowerful then falls in love with jet li you best have some great fighting to go with it if you are looking for an original hk jet li movie i suggest you go rent shaolin temple  aka kids from shaolin
