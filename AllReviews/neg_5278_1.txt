NEG i have seen many  possibly too many straighttovideo no budget slasher films and have developed a taste for the good ones or the ones that are less sucky as ridiculous as that sounds hahaha dr chopper is what i kindly like to refer to as absolute crap nothing about it is enjoyable  the acting sucks the characters suck the killer sucks the gore is minimal and sucks it is about a group of college friends who drive out to a newly discovered family cabin owned by the parents of one of the kids it is meant to be a relaxing retreat but little do they know that a deathly ill former plastic surgeongone bad along with his two female assistants search for usable tissue to save the doctor his name is dr chopper since he rides around on a motorcycle and of course chops this is just a terrible movie not worthy of anyones time enough said
