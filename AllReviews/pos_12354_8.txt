POS sheba baby is always underrated most likely because it has a pg rating instead of the usual r rating that a grier movie gets all that the pg means is that pam doesnt take her top off she takes her top off in every other movie shes been in though so it is more exciting than coffy more action it takes off slow but by the time shes on screen the thrills have started like dolemite durville martin is the heavy trying to get shebas father but she aint having that she wages a one woman war against martin and his gang of cronies the best scene is with a stupid pimp in his car which im still laughing about i thought it would be stupid because of the pg rating but i was wrong it replaces sex with violence and in a blaxplotation film that can only be good
