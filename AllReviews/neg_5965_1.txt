NEG this movie is a complete and utter waste of time one of the worst films ive ever seen and coming from me that is definitely saying something in fact i wish i could have given it negative stars instead of just rating it as a pathetic onestar awfulbr br when i rented this movie i had an open mind i find the legend of the chupacabra interesting and i have a fondness for cheesy horror flicks but i draw the line at this onebr br the acting sucked the lead male gives one of the worst performances ever looking and sounding unnatural as he delivers his poorly written lines the lead female gives a slightly more palatable performance but that really doesnt take muchbr br the chupacabra well considering how low budget this movie must have been the creature was tolerable it does however look exactly like someone in a mask and body suit the mask is fairly detailed and might look cool in person but not so on screenbr br speaking of on screen youd think they could have at least used a better camera it looks like it was shot with a camcorder for crying out loud not a very good one eitherbr br i dont know what whoever wrote this abomination was thinking the dialog sucks and just i cant describe what i feel about it at least not without getting in trouble with the sitebr br my advice avoid this at all costs its just not worth it if it comes on tv and you have nothing else to do or watch then find something else to do or watch read a book listen to music anything just dont subject yourself to this if you do you cannot say you werent warned and for lord and ladys sake dont rent this sucker it is not worth it even if you get the chance to rent it for fifty cents trust me i know
