POS so ya think youve seen every mafia movie ever made heres one that nobody every heard of its a lowbudget quickie bmovie  shot in the swamps of jersey for us mobmovie fans it had a little bit of everything  sex violence cursing and wise guys acting like gafones while violence dominated the movie i found myself laughing at some familiar scenes ive since seen on the sopranos and goodfellas look for a  version of the badabing girls in the beginning of the movie br br all our favorite mobster stereotypes were featured here and as for realism fugettaboutit joe pesci was superb portraying the classic wiseguy character like we seen him do so many times over the years this was probably his first shot and it was a gem pesci fans should run to the video store to check out this flick you have to look carefully for it since it goes by different names my copy called it the family enforcer here it is known as the death collector but whatever name it goes under its should be called  a winner
