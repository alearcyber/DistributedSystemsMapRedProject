POS this was my second experience of the monkey island series the full seven years after i had been shown the first game what was my response oh great were playing a cartoon im glad my brother shut me up then and played on because the jokes caught my attention once again as well as armatos wonderful voiceacting of guybrush  not to mention everyone else done well i still think cmis elaine sounds better than emis the cutscenes do well to illustrate something happening and the art of both the game and cutscenes are excellent when we found the cd with the originals secret and lechucks revenge we were both ecstatic and spent hours working through revenge  one such moment was where we just sat down and blew half a day on it however cmi has to be the monkey island game ive played the most especially for the return of swordfighting and combat on the high seas that moment when you encounter kenny and he tells you hes gone straight and then im running guns had both my brother and i in tears from laughter and thats not the best part of the game not by far
