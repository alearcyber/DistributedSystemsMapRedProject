POS this might be my favorite so bad its awesome film of all time like many preteen children of the s repeat viewing of revenge of ninja spawned a ninja phase of my childhood man i thought sho k was badass back then jet li could wup him with both legs in a cast this movie has insane crossovers that include flashdancethe exorcist and the lee van cleef ninja tv show ugh but as a friend of mine says anyone can get a good movie made it takes true genius to make a film that starts with a ninja surviving  shotgun blasts long enough to take over the body of arobics instructor to get revenge wow while previous commentors have metioned the sword flying out of the closet on the string no one has yet metioned the powerful love scene where the sexy leading man cop takes off his shirt to reveal a mane of backhair the fun never ends rent this
