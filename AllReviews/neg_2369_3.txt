NEG the film version of rising damp came out two years after the television series ended like many fans i duly went along to the cinema when it opened i came away bitterly disappointed eric chappell could not have spent very much time writing the script most of it is rehashed ideas from old episodes at the time of the films release the rising damp series was still being repeated regularly on itv so the public was being asked to pay to see something theyd seen already at least the on the buses movies boasted original screenplaysbr br secondly richard beckinsale had died the year before so they eliminated the character of alan as a mark of respect substituting art student john played by christopher strauli of only when i laugh fame it simply wasnt the samebr br as another poster has pointed out rigsbys boarding house looked nothing like the one used in the series being bigger and altogether cleanerbr br director joe mcgrath was one of the directors who worked on the original casino royale a film steeped in surreal humour rising damp also has its share of walter mitty style fantasy sequences such as the saturday night fever parody personally i found them horribly out of place a case of overegging the puddingbr br on the plus side leonard rossiter is as magnificent as ever as the seedy rigsby as are frances de la tour as ruth and don warrington as philip its just a shame the film isnt worthy of their talentsbr br when rossiter died in  it was shown by itv as a tribute with its final scene  showing rigsby laying prostrate at the foot of the stairs  removed in the interests of good taste
