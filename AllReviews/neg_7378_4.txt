NEG first off im in the usbr br when i first saw this i thought it was an obvious  and loathsome  rip off of the office uk i would have thus awarded it zero stars but lo and behold it came out long before the ricky gervais seriesbr br still its hard to watch this or any other show with a similar dynamic including the american office without comparison it just isnt even close to being the same thingbr br i will give it some credit for being original and ahead of its time ill also say that it  and the us office and larry sanders  are actual satires the uk office is something grander and more transcendent as if populated with real people in events that felt like they actually happened however unlike this or the shrill christopher guest mockumentaries it isnt really a satire while the newsroom definitely isbr br be that as it may the newsroom still isnt very funny its aloof and selfaware but with a cast and crew not nearly smart or talented enough to heft the goods its weighty comedy being carried on weak shoulders commendable but ultimately not recommendedbr br  and whats with the lack of an anamorphic dvd i know it was shot in anamorphic widescreen because i saw the pilot episode on one of our hd channels cbc get with the programme
