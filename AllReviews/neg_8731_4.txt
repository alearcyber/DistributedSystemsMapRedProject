NEG i suppose im supposed to take something like this with a grain of salt these laboratory movies and yes they spend a lot of time in the laboratory always fail in one dimension there is an understanding that single people fooling around have uncovered secrets beyond the comprehension of anyone to this time of course they pay a price because their experimenting has the same shortcomings that dr frankensteins did there is always something they didnt anticipate there are so many things from pure science to fashion for young ladies to outrageous cover ups that dont work here the young woman is certainly fetching and the doctor cant help himself but he could have been a little bit discreet or even made an effort to shelter what he was doing things go wrong and because of this intellect she gains tremendous power including an understanding of how she came to be rock hudson looks pretty fit here he never quite makes it in this role however it wanders all over with lots of clichs and silliness which diminishes the basic issue once she has her revenge a more suitable thing would be for her to wander off and allow him to seek her out and destroy her in some grand way
