POS danny boyle was not the first person to realise that zombies can run like the clappers that honour belongs to lifeforce which is of course the greatest naked space vampire zombies from halleys comet running amok in london endoftheworld movie ever made tobe hooper may have made a lot of crap but for this deliriously demented epic scifi horror he deserves a place among the immortals plus it offers space vampire mathilda may the best thing to come out of france since simone simon spending the entire movie naked which she does very very well just bear in mind that while she is the most overwhelmingly feminine presence anyone on earth has ever encountered shes also totally alien to this planet and our life form and totally dangerous its a pitch meeting id have loved to have sat in on astronauts from the british space program find three naked humanoid alien life forms inside a giant mile long artichokeumbrella shaped spaceship hidden in the tail of halleys comet filled with giant desiccated bats and bring them back to earth with near apocalyptic results as they proceed to drain the population of london of their lifeforce amid much nudity whirlpools of thunder and spit your coffee across the room direlogue ive been in space for six months and she looks perfect to me assume we know nothing which is understating the matter dont worry a naked woman is not going to get out of this complex oh and well get the writers of alien and blue thunder to write it with uncredited rewrites by the writer of mark of the devil the sex thief and eskimo nell and the director of the jonestown monster sounds like a winner heres m  have fun and they do they dobr br true theres enough promise in the raw material to have made something genuinely creepy and thoughtprovoking at a time when aids hysteria was approaching its height a sexually transmitted plague offers ample opportunity for allegory but in the hands of the gogo boys at cannon what could have been another quatermass and the pit quickly turns instead to be more plan  from outer space its fulltobursting with delirious inanity be it frank finlays hilarious death scene here i go peter firths grand entrance im colonel caine from the sas discreetly shouts michael gothard across a room full of reporters gentlemen that last remark was not for publication this is a dnotice situation he replies to the surprisingly obliging pressmen the security guards offering mathilda mays naked space vampire a nice biscuit to stop her escaping reanimated bodies exploding into dust all over people the sweaty prime minister sucking the life out of his secretary and london filling up with zombie nuns stockbrokers and joggers as the city gets its most comprehensive on screen trashing since mrs gorgo lost junior at battersea funfair and went on the rampage and thats not mentioning the this woman is a masochist an extreme masochist scene or the great stereophonic echo effect on the male vampires itll be a lot less terrifying if you just come to me line while a leadstake wielding peter firth adopts his best action man voice to reply ill do just that in one scene alone you have a possessed patrick stewart embodying the female in our deeply confused astronaut heros mind steve inevergotoverplayingcharliemanson railsback and his amazing dancing eyebrows in fullon heltaskelta mode trying to resist the temptation to kiss him the inimitable aubrey morris the only man who makes freddie jones look restrained playing the home secretary sir percy heseltine as a kind of demented brian rix peter firth one of those actors who always looks like he must have been a doctor who around the time noone was watching it anymore hamming up the blas public school macho in the hope that noone will ever see it and the peerless reaction shots of john hallam as the male nurse who keeps on opening the door midpsychictornado to bring in more drugs as if they needed any more in this film its just a shame that frank finlays madhaired scientist who isnt qualified to certify death on alien life forms a role originally intended for klaus kinski missed out on the action in that onebr br no matter how mad you think the film is it still manages to get madder still whether it be a zombie pathologist he too needs feeding exploding all over the home secretarys suit patrick stewarts blood and entrails forming a naked mathilda may or the space vampires turning st pauls cathedral into the worlds biggest lasershow to transport human souls from the london underground to their geostationary mother ship i loved every gloriously insane moment in its own truly unique way this might be the greatest film ever madebr br the dvd offers the original minute version that opened in the uk rather than the heavily edited minute us version which not only offers much more hilarity for your dollar but also fully restores henry mancinis score to its original glory the us version covered a lot of the gaps with additional cues by michael kamen and james guthrie although a somewhat surprising choice at first sight mancini cut his teeth on many of the classic universal scifi horrors of the s and his score is quite superb with a terrific driving main title that offers a rare reminder of just how interesting he could be away from blake edwards sadly theres no more than a trailer by way of extras though it would be nice to hope some day for a special edition with some of the deleted scenes from hoopers originally intended minute cut from whats on display here these might just offer even more comedy gold
