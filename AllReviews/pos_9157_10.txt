POS hey you are not alone i remember nichols i was just  when it was on i remember james garner was one of the coolest actors and nichols was such a great show i couldnt believe it was on such a short time wish i could remember the last episode i probably didnt see itthere were no vcrs back then so it when it was on you saw it and if you missed an episode it was gone forever unless it came back on summer reruns anyway sure would be great if it came out on dvd but i dont think that many people even knew about it what a shamebr br garner would hit it big a few years later with rockford files and he brought along his buddy stuart margolin from nichols to play his sidekick angel
