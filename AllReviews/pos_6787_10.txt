POS wow what a lovely warm rural film the story focuses upon mi taylor mickey rooney a young male wanderer whose journey takes him to a quiet rural coastal town there he stays with the brown family velvet liz taylor their youngest daughter who mi subtly befriends has a passion for horses and wins one at an auction this horse is a beautiful maroon stallion referred by its previous owner as a murderous pirate but velvet renames him pie not long later velvet suggests to enter him in the grand national race mi and her family are against the idea but soon agree and velvet and mi began to train him for britains most famous horse race  this film is a beautiful example of what british films are like i remember i first saw this when i was eight and on my summer holidays my parents taped it off the tv and i warmed to it instantly  watching it most days instead of the large collection of disney films that i ownedbr br i believe it was one of liz taylors first movies and a good one her character is nave but sweet  her acting is extremely convincing especially when she portrays her love for horses its also a good chance to see angela lansbury in one of her early roles who costars as velvets older sister who spends most of her time in the film being smitten with a boy in the town i must say she was a gorgeous lady when she was younger beautiful blonde hair and a rosy cheeked face although she doesnt have a major part in the movie she dose have a number of scenes  so not to disappoint her fans parents reading this i must emphasis  if you can get hold of a copy of this please do if youre children love animals  i strongly suggest you show it to them they may find a few scenes boring but you see velvet riding the horse on many occasions throughout the film and would most defiantly entertain children a lovely and nostalgic film i might just go away now and put it on
