POS i liked this a lot br br the camera angles are cool its not all jumpy like a blair witch and i thought they did a great job with the sound when we see things from kanes point of view lots of fun plenty of people were shouting at the screen br br kane did a great job with his various psycho emotions hes a lot less onedimensional than most horror heroesbr br kane is a lot less scary and more believable than most movie psychos it was not clear to me how he would react to various situations there are not many twists here but it is clever and original in its own way good creepy bmovie slasher fare
