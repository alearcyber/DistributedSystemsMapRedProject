NEG as a child of the s like so many of the other reviewers here i hated the original v and v the final battle i own both on vhs and never hook up the vcr to watch them i do remember not liking this short lived series very much but i couldnt remember why so i rented the first disc by the third episode i had my memory refreshed its terrible the writing is beyond horrid its not even fun they had a lot of material to work with here but it seemed like they just didnt know what to do so they turned it into days of our lives with lizard aliens how cool and full of potential is the concept of elizabeth the starchild all they could think of to do is grow her into a whiny boring teenager to compete with her mother romantically marc singer looked less embarrassed to be in beastmaster ii than he did when he was trapped in this drivelpoint is whether youre one of the younger folk whos just discovered v or one of us older scifi fans looking to rediscover some old fun spare yourself and skip this
