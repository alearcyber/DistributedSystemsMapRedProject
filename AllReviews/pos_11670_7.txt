POS first off let it be known that i came into this movie not for the music actually i find it repugnant really i was interested in the psychology of the punk subculture on this point the documentary did fairly well one disagreeable aspect was the numerous scenes in which songs are played and the hypedup band and belligerent crowd are shown running amok if youve seen the first such scene youve seen them all this superfluity is party made up for by printing lyrics for some of the songs with these the audience is able to somewhat connect mentally with the band the lyrics are of far more interest than the jumble of sounds projecting from the speakers i dont know why all the lyrics were not printed scenes without lyrics slow ironic eh given the many references to the speed of the music the flow of the movie also insightful were the interviews with fans and bands though there is a letdown when the latter bands interviews prove to be not nearly as enthralling or humorous as the first two overall a good movie that im glad i saw ill check out the followups if i ever get a chancebr br favorite quote he tried to hide the fact that he couldnt play by rubbing peanut butter over himself and breaking glass br br broad punk generalization though their disgracefulness lack of vocabulary and hygiene and druginduced obliviousness is often hilarious in the end it is understood that punks are just pathetic juveniles who rebel just for the sake of rebellion as seen through sophomoric lyrics and naive attempts to philosophize and politicize disregarding black flag who are slightly less misguided than their peers
