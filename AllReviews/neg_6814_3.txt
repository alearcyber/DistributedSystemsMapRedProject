NEG very stark very drab no real drama why not just make a documentary this isnt exactly the passion of joan of arc the only reason for seeing chronicles is to hear the performances i love bachs music and even i found it hard to sit through this misery of a film the great gustav leonhardt plays in two senses of the word bach we dont get much of a sense of him as an actor since hes given so little to do dramatically mostly he gets to walk purposefully or angrily out of various rooms bachs life of course was not an errol flynn movie it was indeed fairly drab and more than a little hard this probably means that the life isnt a terrific candidate for a film the music of course is another story i recommend the stations of bach far more information for one thing and some insight into the music which is after all why bach interests us in the first place
