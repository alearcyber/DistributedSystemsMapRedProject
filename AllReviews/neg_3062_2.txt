NEG wow pretty amazing that something this bad could actually be made i am giving this movie a  because it is so bad it has a certain car wreck kind of appeal its so bad its comical and that does have a certain entertainment value plus there is a bit of gratuitous nudity and that is always appreciatedbr br so where do i begin the acting is beyond awful its like you are watching a high school play being filmed theresa russell must have done something really bad to have been forced to make this movie and her acting reflects how happy she is to be in the middle of this messbr br the rest of the cast is simply silly with the casting of dan cortese as an fbi agent the cherry on the top of this piece of crap his acting actually had me laughing at loudbr br as for the screenplay and the directing c courtney joyner and mark l lester should simply be taken out back and shot
