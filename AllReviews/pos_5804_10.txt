POS madonna has been rocking the boat for over  years and with that comes a lot of experience obviously and a lot of knowledge she was never the one to think about yesterday au contraire she seemed to know what is going to be popular tomorrow she bravely takes all the new trends technologies and incorporates them into her own acts her world tours have never been average when madonna performs she gives   everything is bigger better theatrical and meaningful she takes inspirations from east west and makes then unique everything is given a deeper meaning and the confessions tour is not different from the very beginning you find yourself sitting on the edge of the chair she starts with bang then she does brave circus poses on a horse high up in the sky she does everything she can to entertain you she remakes her own songs giving them a modern feel she sings on a disco cross she almost comes in the middle of the stage and with her amazing dance crew that know no dimensions of fear the show is absolutely more than you bargained for its a spectacle an audiovisual orgasm that cannot be put in words lucky are the ones who actually experienced seeing madonna on stage pushing fifty she is still in an incredible form recent sticky and sweet tour is even more groundbreaking which proves nothing else that madonna was is and ever be the one and the only queen of pop
