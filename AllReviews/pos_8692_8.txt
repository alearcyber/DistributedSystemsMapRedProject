POS despite its age this film retains its undoubted charm and attraction and is a fine surviving example of early british cinema it has an underlying air of eeriness interspersed with shafts of humour which are not out of place and serve to demonstrate the assured direction  production values involved so many episodic type films are disjointed and untidy but this is not one of them the standard of acting helps a great deal and the various disparate characters come across as interesting and believable all in all this longforgotten little gem is well worth anyones attention in spite of the one jarring note in the film which surprisingly escaped the censors attention
