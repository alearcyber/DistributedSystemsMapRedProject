POS rowan atkinson delivers an unforgettable performance as the clueless mr bean who never goes far without his teddy bear the appeal of mr bean is largely his childish behavior and innocence we dont know if he came from the sky or another planet he is the kind of strange character that you cant make up quite easily he is often alone and used to it he has a hard time communicating through speech which might be why we only hear his grunts at times there are other characters who speak to him and he responds the character of mr bean is a mystery and still is he lives alone and does the unthinkable when he can do the sensible thing mr bean is rather an odd man out who does not mind it much he rather live a simple life with his yellow car and teddy bear and hopes to get to work on time
