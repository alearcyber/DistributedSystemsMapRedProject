NEG coc had its moments i enjoyed the action sequences but i despised the screenplay and plot i hate this film so much ill just write about the dumbest part first of all the plot would never happen second the bleakness of the chinese president was uncalled for that would never happen finally the dialogue employing nonchinese actors to play chinese roles is understandable but to write dialogue for them thats totally off is dumb for those of you who understood the chinese in the film you know what i mean
