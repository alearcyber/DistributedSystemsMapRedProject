NEG there are lots of other comments here about how poor this film is what i wanted to point out is how this film took the largest science project in history and made it look small the manhattan project was an incredible achievement and it was huge virtually all silver in the country went into making wire for electromagnetic separators if there was every a choice between two alternative ways of doing things they just did both the first sustained nuclear reactor was fired up under the stands of the university of chicago football stadium with graduate students wielding axes as a scram mechanism its a fascinating story involving hundreds of locations and thousands of people that this film seems to reduce to a small group of eccentrics in new mexicobr br the other thing i really disliked was the huge moral debate over if we should continue the project after germany surrenders okay we have thousands of mostly men who worked for years to make a really big boom does anyone think they didnt want to see it work there was some controversy at the time about if we should use the device but it was not that serious clearly not the huge debate this film makes it out to be
