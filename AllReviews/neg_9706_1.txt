NEG i went to see suspecting i would hate it i did everything about it was wrong it was like they were filming a different book granted the locations and houses very lovely if not a little miscastyes even the house were wrong for their parts keira was too modern dull and frankly i found it unpleasant to watch her were everyone else sees darcy as a sex god the writer of this saw him as sexually frustrated and inadequate bingley was stupid and dippy he isnt meant to be and the bennetts were shown to be destitute and for some unknown reason farmers this is incorrect and ludicrous the very idea that mr bennett would answer the door in his night gear with the rest of the family dressed in their underwear to in the middle of the night is stupid they had servants mr collins was not repulsive and greasy merely stupid and obnoxious georgina darcy was ugly and old and miss bingley wore a sleeveless dress what as if it is historically inaccurate and even the ending is unsatisfying i could go on for days i hated it so much as not only was it nothing like the book but i fear that for many people it will be their fist experience of this great novel and it will give them the worst possible idea of it the bbc version is so superior its not even funny and everything about this version is an insult to its memory in short if you must see it be sure you have read the book first or seen the bbc version other wise you will be lead done the deluded road that this is what its like which its not
