POS but quite dated today otto preminger made this movie without the certificate of approval that was needed then it was enormously courageous and risky as he could have lost his investment and futurebr br the film is not true to the wonderful book and is unfortunately hollywoodizedbr br frank sinatra and ive never been a fan playing frankie machine is astonishing in his performance one forgets it is frank up there the level of realism he brings to the role of a jonesing drug addict has to be seen to be believedbr br kim novak eternally gorgeous and talented does not disappoint in the role of the devoted outsider always there for frankiebr br supporting roles particularly a young handsome and talented darrin mc gavin are faultlessbr br eleanor parker playing frankies wife is hopelessly inept she swings from irritating to melodramatic and is far too over the top a forgettable performancebr br the stagey cheap settings are appalling as if a firm gust of wind would blow the whole tacky painted cardboards over the horizon almost laughable at times in their tawdry cheapnessbr br the music was irritating poundingly so at times as if each nuance of the script example when louie is getting frankie his fix out of a drawer had to be underscored at a high decibel levelbr br  out of  sinatra truly deserved his oscar nomination worth seeing
