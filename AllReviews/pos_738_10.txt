POS back in the s a smalltime texas filmmaker named sf brownrigg directed a handful of surprisingly decent lowbudget drivein horror flicks which seem to have developed a small cult following over the years before viewing his first film dont look in the basement i wasnt too sure what to expect but i sure as hell didnt expect it to turn out to be the only texas horror i thought was better than the chainsaw massacre i dont know this might actually be my alltime favorite horror moviebr br we begin in an isolated insane asylum at first it seems like a rather laidback place to get mentally healthy considering all the patients are allowed to roam around freely and whatnot as if it were their house i guess it is none of them seem all that dangerous only delusional the residents include a lovenympho a  year old woman a manchild a spaz a guy who thinks hes in a war a woman who thinks she has a baby and a guy who thinks hes a judge one day out of nowhere judge kills the doctor with an axe shortly thereafter the wannabe baby mama kills the nurse ten minutes into the movie and things are looking really ugly perhaps the new nurse will know what to do then again perhaps not giving away more would do more harm than good its best to plunge head first into this one knowing as little as possible if you can appreciate honesttogod untampered with horror then you will not be disappointed br br if you liked scream if you liked wrong turn if you go for that unoriginal overproduced overscored digital hollywood garbage then chances are high you just wont see the beauty in this one dont look in the basement being a first attempt makes the quality all the more shocking the atmosphere and the graininess fit into the location and the score like a glove unfortunately good ol sf used up most of his good ideas on his first movie although the next entry in his texassized quadrilogy is somewhat of a masterpiece that is if youre into extra sleazy meanspirited hixploitation like someone i know if you fall in love with brownriggs first two and absolutely must find out what else he had to offer check out dont open the door and the house where hell froze over dont look in the basement has everything that successful horror needs no stars no budget no digital effects just an original story brought to life in an insane asylum with a dozen cast members and a somber subtle score and of course the twist this is real horror for the real horror fan
