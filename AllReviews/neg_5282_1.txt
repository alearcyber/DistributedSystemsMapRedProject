NEG first of all im upset theres no choice of a  out of  br br i was bored tonight and while flipping through the channels i see dr chopper with there being nothing else on i decide to watch it expecting it to be just another crappy horror movie with a similar plot to cabin fever br br man was i wrongdr chopper made cabin fever look like it should have won numerous academy awards may i remind you cabin fever contains a scene of a little hick boy doing roundhouse kicks off of a porch screaming pancakes characters who leave their dying friend in a tiny shack to bleed to death and shawn from boy meets world mistakenly fingering a hole in a girls thighbr br so needless to say dr chopper was a big smelly pileocrap it wasnt even funny crap it reminded me of a horror movie i had to make in th grade called the campout except for the fact that the campout had a better script we wrote it about an hour before filming better actors plots bloody scenes and camera work i was hoping to get some laughs out of a poorlymade horror film but instead i could only watch in astonishment as i thought to myself was this made by th graders br br the acting was horrible the events and different little subplots were thrown together and didnt make sense and the gore and violence was very minimal i liked how that from a small stab wound people died instantly and the only weapons the killers had were small pocket knivesif youre going to make a horror movie at least give the killers an insane killing devicebr br also what the hell was the point of the sorority girls hazing their pledges good way to bring in some scenes of girls running around in their bras even if they have no relevance to the story whatsoever and i must say my favorite line was when the blonde says to dr chopper id like to introduce you to someonemy inner bitch her inner bitch then proceeds to grab a garbage can throw it at dr chopper miss and back up in terror of the killerbr br whewwwell that was a long one but i felt that i needed to express my feelings on how absolutely horrible this movie was i know that everyone has their own opinions but if anyone rates this movie higher than a  they should be shot to hellbr br seriously
