NEG the best way to have fun in this movie is to count how many clichs it is rehashing snarling chinese gangsters a female vicepresident a ventilator duct that happens to be big enough to fit a big caucasian male shooting through the wall to kill the bad guy a situation where you need to snuff out some innocent people to prevent armageddon independence day scenes where you snuff out some memorable landmarks in a fireball the vice president in a nice well lighted room surrounded by subordinates while the chinese premier virtually alone in a dark room with just bit of dim light shining snarling as viciously as the slimy gangsters a lone hero left alone in a ship building airplane whatever wreaking havoc on clueless bad guys with big automatic weapons etc etc etcbr br the second best way is to count how many zeroes you need to put after the decimal to accurately gauge the probability of the film scenario i counted up to  a president agreeing to a meeting on board a private vessel the impossibly nonoverridable command from the nuke box the part where the chinese decided to play shoot em up etc etc man the earth is more likely fall into the sun than for this film to happen br br i admit the film was interesting until the point the evil taiwanese gangsters kidnapped the president then the boredom kicked in suspension of disbelief ceased and i started thinking the fun id have torturing this film
