NEG spiderman was one of the first comic books to initiate a change in the genre in spite of being a very well made superhero comic book this is the first series ever that added a real psychological depth to the main character had complex moral issue round characters and also highlighted social and political issues in other words spiderman was the comic books coming of age this tv series lacks all of those components its just a straightforward good buy  bad guy tv series suffering from obvious budgetary rerstraints that make the action scene moderately exciting spiderman nylon webbing is about as convincing as the cardboard rocks in star trek nicholas hammond is way too old for the role at that point in time i think he was well into his thirties wheras spiderman was really teenager at the time for some unfathomable reason the writers also changed names and deleted important characters from the comic book which again just resulted in the tension between characters basically disappearing
