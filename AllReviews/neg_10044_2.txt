NEG if you took all the stock elements of a shrek movie grumpy ogre annoying donkey cute kitty obligatory dance number etc put them in a blender and condensed it to  minutes youd have this mess painful to watch i may have laughed once the story and dialogue are rushed beyond comprehension with the voice actors sounding like they phoned in their lines the final reworked rendition of the christmas story poem felt like it was written by a committee in five minutes and boy a little eddie murphy goes a long way with its desperate attempt to be hip and current this show will be long outdated and forgotten while classics like the grinch will remain timeless a sad waste of effort by all involved a veritable jumping of the shark for the shrek franchise
