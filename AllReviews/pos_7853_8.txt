POS i thought that eastwoods most unusual role was that in the bridges of madison county but that was until i saw the beguiled he manages to pull it off giving a very good performance and so does the rest of the cast the direction is imaginative given that the film was made in  and had there not been some plot holes  which the director seems to struggle to cover up at times  we would be talking about an excellent film it remains powerful nonethelessbr br
