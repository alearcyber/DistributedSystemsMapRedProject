NEG this movie obviously had good intentions at the end there is a dedication to someone named kellie who as a viewer i can only assume found herself in a situation similar to the one the movie depicts perhaps she made the wrong choice that dedication is the only redeeming quality of love  suicidebr br the movie becomes unbearable from the opening sequence once the viewer is already that irritated only about five minutes into the film its pretty much going to be downhill after thatwhich it was i know the film was low budget and the camera shots were actually pretty goodunfortunately everything else was horrid the acting the plot the sound quality the picture qualitythe acting im sorry but the acting is horrible beyond horrible its as if the actors are trying to act like people acting thats the only way i can think to describe it as i watched i actually pictured the script with the stage direction in my mind none of the movements were natural and none of the characters reactions to one another fit in short the timing is way off the timing of the entire film is way off im no director so i know the limits of my knowledge but i really feel there had to be some way to convey the passing of timeuntil they explained about graduation not being too far away i was under the impression that the first portion of the movie had taken place over the span of a weeka month at mostbr br all that being said its really a shame this movie truly could have been powerful with a little tweaking all the moments in the film in which we are supposed to feel something are obvious but only because the setup is obvious which is a bad thing the moving scenes totally fell flat for instance when kayes brother takes his hat of his head and puts it on hers we should feel the understanding he has for her the innocence and protectiveness of the love of her brothersomehow it just doesnt come off that way there are so many more scenes like this for example all of the fight scenes and all they do is take away from the movie all these things put together love  suicide comes off as one long cheesy lowbudget commercial
