POS this film essentially contains all the elements of a great s exploitation film except it was done in the late s for the direct to video marketbr br you have a young couple in love but the whole world around them is involved either in crack dealing or gang violence when the boyfriend goes to jail the girlfriend ends up vulnerable to all the criminals who are everyone in this movie except for the cops first she gets hooked on crack by a dealer and then because he owes drug lord jim brown money she becomes browns property then shes basically enslaved in a military style crack house that the movie is named forbr br as if this isnt enough reason to see this movie you also have anthony geary playing a seemingly conservative school guidance counselor but hes really a major crack dealer in a sleazy yet hilarious scene he demands sexual favors from the heroine because she has no money for a fix in an earlier scene it was established that he is her counselor that scene and another where jim brown forces her to take a scalding hot shower because she stinks are hysterical lead actress cheryl kay was really good in this film tarantino bring her backbr br its not surprising to me that someone mentioned in another review that tarantino is a major fan of this it has just the right blend of comedy action sex romance and yes a central message to stay away from drugs jim browns villainous turn here deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as another great s b villain wings hauser in vice squad sometimes i think there should be a b movie oscars where performances like this could be acknowledged in the meantime lets hope that the modern straight to dvd filmmakers learn learn to use this same type of tongue in cheek humor
