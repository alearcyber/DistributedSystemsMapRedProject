NEG did people expect jurassic park  to be full of surprises not one moment of it is worth it many elements could easily scare people out of the moviesand its not the dinos tea leonii think shes a great actress but im sorry to say that this time she reached the bottom line i wonder if she happened to strain a vocal chord while shooting the movielaura dernshes ok but why not be more noticeable in the movie maybe exchange smart dialogs with sam neil alessandro nivola  have you ever heard of something called facial expression fellings emotionshes got to work harder on that sam neil no big deal the soundtrackgot to change that record or you get tired of it my applause goes to william h macy a talented actor who ive never seen playing a bad roleunfortunately he cant save the movie nor can the well computercreated dinosaurs
