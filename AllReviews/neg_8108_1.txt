NEG no spoiler needed to steer you clear of thiswell bizarre film canada becomes part of the usa ok so i guess im unusual but i expected something about the implications of canada becoming part of the usa silly me continue with this movie and you are off to cloud coocoo land the opening premise has nothing to do with the rest of the film in which you will trust me not care a squat for any of the characters slings and arrows and due south have to be among the most imaginative series ever but in this case paul gross im so very sorry to say didnt have a clue about making a coherent film and wasted a lot of talented actors in the process a real disappointment
