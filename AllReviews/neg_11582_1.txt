NEG probably the worst creature feature everboa vs python was a million times better then this  that wasnt great eitherbad actingbad effects  guess what the dvd is one of those one with  hours of previews before the main menuprobably the least scary movie everno blood or violencepeople are stupid and keep using pistols when they have no affect on these animals the only cool part was the radioactive leeches that was pretty cooli name of the island is just a rip off of jurassic park boring tiring  not worth even looking at but i suppose the characters stupidity is pretty funny so it would make a good comedy film but definitely not a thriller
