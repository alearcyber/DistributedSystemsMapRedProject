POS in defense of this movie i must repeat what i had stated previously the movie is called arachina it has a no name cast and i do not mean no name as in actors who play in little seen art house films i mean no name as in your local high school decided to make a film no name and it might have a  dollar budget so what does one expect hitchcockbr br i felt the movie never took itself seriously which automatically takes it out of the worst movie list that list is only for big budget all star cast movies that takes itself way too seriously the movie the oscar comes to mind most of sylvester stallones movies the two leads were not hepburn and tracy but they did their jobs well enough for this movie the woman kicked butt and the guy was not a blithering idiot the actor who played the old man was actually very good the man who played anal retentive professor was no clifton webb but he did a god job and the bimbos for lack of a better were played by two competent actors i laughed at the  cent special effects but that was part of the charm of the movie it played like a hybrid tremors meets night of the living dead the premise of the movie is just like all giant bug movies of the s a meteor or radiation stir up the ecosystem and before you know it we have giant ants lobsters rocks or lizards terrorizing the locals a meteor was the cause of the problems this time i was was very entertained i didnt expect much and i go a lot more then i bargained for
