NEG the movie heart of darkness is an insult to the book by joseph conrad to be quite honest the movie made me want to fall asleep on the other hand the book was definitely extraordinary i feel that the movie left out several key elements and missed some of the main points from the book in addition the actors were boring and lacked originality and enthusiasmbr br the book while not an adventure story or easy to understand is full of hidden meaning and interesting twists in the plot the book though very confusing and complex is astonishing when you do finally understand it you feel as if you have actually learned something the novella or short story had several key ideas like futility and craziness which the movie left out in addition several key scenes were changed which in return affected the entire plot many of the scenes seemed to be very choppy in the sense that they did not fit together in summary the movie seemed to be a bad interpretation of the book br br i would only recommend watching this movie if you cannot picture or understand the book but otherwise i would skip this one it was dreadful and in complete disarray if you have never read the book then definitely do not watch the movie because you need the basic information from the book to understand the movie the movie was a horrible spinoff of an outstanding and detailed book
