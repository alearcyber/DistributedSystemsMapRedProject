NEG if i didnt know any better i would have thought resurrection was made in the late searly s when crap sold as film in hollywoodbr br i dont understand why people like christopher lambert he speaks like hes reading off of cue cards and turns into a fountain whenever he has to emote he was easily the movies weakest aspect the other actors were ok nothing horriblebr br its easy to see where the majority of the budget went the special effects the killings look pretty professional but hardly make up for the films dullnessbr br i wouldnt go as far as to say resurrection is a carbon copy of seen but it certainly bears a certain resemblance to it centering on a religiousminded murderer on a modern crusade the detectives investigating his work have to rely on bible passages and christian history to piece together the killers puzzle resurrection however is bereft of seens clever storytelling cinematography actingwell everything that makes it good instead resurrection lies to the audience and uses the scooby doo method of mystery to surprise itbr br in conclusion resurrection was about as bad as i expected it to be i almost feel bad for criticizing this movie since i knew it would be bad going in butsue me
