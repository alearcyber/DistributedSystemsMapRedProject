NEG eugene oneills  and a half hour  play brought to the screen in less than two hours the plays combination of symbolic dialogue and gothic melodrama hasnt aged very well and the cast has some difficulty with it especially norma shearers nina and ralph morgans marsden clark gable as ned darrell comes off better but mostly because his is a gruff character not given to the philosophical musings of the others which better fits gables range once the plot settles down to the love quadrangle and the audience adjusts to the voiceover asides the film does become more enjoyable the technique used here for the asides is another problem on stage the action froze while the actors spoke their thoughts to the audience here theyre done as voiceovers youd think that would work better but since the action no longer freezes the actors are forced to pause speaking and grimace at the camera to match the emotions in their thoughts plus its difficult for any movie buff to watch this film and not think of groucho marxs hilarious parody version in animal crackers added to these drawbacks are some cuts made for censorship reasons ninas promiscuity is softpeddled and there is no mention of her getting the abortion that is more central in the play and a wretched score uncredited that sounds like background music to a turnofthecentury weepie oneill called this film a dreadful hash of attempted condensation and idiotic censorship and although strange interlude is nowhere near as great as his later the iceman cometh and long days journey into night it certainly deserved better than this
