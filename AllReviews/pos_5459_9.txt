POS the late shift is a great book i read the book several years ago and i was transfixed at the cutthroat debauchery that went on when johnny carson retired and jay leno and johnny carson tried to grab his spot when the movie came out i snagged a vhs copy of the movie and having reread the book recently its hard to say which i enjoy more because theyre quite equal in the amount of information conveyed the two lead actors john michael higgins and daniel roebuck two actors i never heard of before and havent heard of since play leno and letterman convincingly despite lettermans dismissal of his portrayal as being poor they play the parts quite well despite a lot of people looking for an imitation of the two i wasnt as interested in that the story is what counts and that brings me to kathy bates kathy bates playing helen kushnick is this movie she plays this evil bitch of a character so menacingly you realize how on earth can this woman control herself much less a national tv show yikes there should be a sequel
