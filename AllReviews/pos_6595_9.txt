POS not only was this film exhilarating but it took me back down memory lane with its true to life sound track these were the things we were saying and doingthese were the songs we were listening toall during this same time period in the same era way down south in alabama i may not have been one of the skateboard set but i was definitely one of the observers sitting on the curb with the old transistor radio listening to neil young watching those more brave than i ever hoped to be as they put the spin on their surfboards on wheels applying the tricks of alva and adams hoping that maybe just maybe for a brief moment theyd adopt the zephyr style it just goes to show how much alike we all were during those wonderful days  klj
