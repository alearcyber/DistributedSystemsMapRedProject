POS for those of you who have no idea what bug juice is or was it was a childrens reality show about real kids living at summer camp bug juice is the show that inspired me to go to camp it was full of romance friendships fights overcoming your fears and dealing with the struggles of living away from home for  months it was an amazing show that is no longer shown on tv regularly but is amazing nontheless the show was never dull and always attracted my attention its really nice for kids who have never been to a summer camp to really see what its like before going plus disney did a really good job of picking camps to showcase because who wants to see a show thats at a camp for like only a week the length of the camps where perfect for this show and the environment they where in was fantastic they where camps all over the us that each provided unique activities for the campers it was a truly amazing unscripted show
