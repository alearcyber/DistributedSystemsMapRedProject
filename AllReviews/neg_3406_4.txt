NEG let me preface by stating that i have lived in louisville kentucky all of my life i grew up about  mile from waverly in the wintertime we would pull our sleds down maryman road and cross dixie highway to go sleigh riding on waverly hill many times during the winter of  we would climb into the tunnel to warm ourselves the place was still being run as a geriatric center at the time we would go all the way through the tunnel up the hill to bang on what we thought was the door to the morgue i have to be honest the only sensation we felt was that we were getting away with something we should not be doing i would have to say we went up that tunnel over  times that winter nothing stranger than teenaged boys acting stupid ever happened i love the fact that it is getting attention after all these years one evening when i was young we looked out our front porch and it appeared that the entire hill was on fire there was an older hospital on the hill that burned down it burned for hours while the entire neighborhood sat outside and watched the thing that gets lost about waverly is that many people survived tb there lets face itthe doctors back then did everything they thought was correct to save people it took a lot of guts for people to work there knowing how contagious tb was too much is focused on those who suffered i also have traveled into the building several times in the early s we would go and visit shutins in the nursing home through a church youth group by the way the doors there were not prison like steel doors with chains and padlocks as portrayed in the film they were wooden and opensometimes too open it did smell of urine and feces and you saw the occasional open gown associated with patients with dementia it was true that it was closed by the state in the early s a lot of that may have to do with the age of the building or the right guy wasnt paid off this is after all kentucky the part of the documentary that turned me off the most was the piling of bodies into a cart if i am not mistaken it appears to have been holocaust footage that was added for dramatic effect it left me with a sour taste in my mouth for the filmmaker i am a skeptic when it comes to ghosts i do believe that many around here truly think the place to be haunted waverly for me however symbolized a fun place for adventure for a boy with a sled
