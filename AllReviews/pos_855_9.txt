POS this movie is a mystery its not scary its spooky youll probably jump at some points and for some of it youll be scratching your head to figure it out it unfolds its mystery through the main character eve and her psychotic college project at an insane asylum don he needs her to search for some clues to vindicate himself from murdering his mother and once eve agrees to help him she completely opens up pandoras box and unleashes some very strange things including malachi i wont go into malachi but i thought the way that played out was complete genius i know movie buffs wont regard this movie with the same prestige as other classics because it doesnt have anyone very famous in it angelina jolies brother was excellent but maybe he should have asked his sister to show her face just so this movie could get some recognition but i do think the way the malachi ending works is something to talk about ive recommended this to my friends definitely worth the purchase or rental price
