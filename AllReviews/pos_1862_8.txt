POS paul bettany did a great role as the tortured father whose favorite little girl dies tragically of disease for that he deserves all the credit however the movie was mostly about exactly that keeping the adventures of darwin as he gathered data for his theories as incomplete stories told to children and skipping completely the disputes regarding his ideasbr br two things bothered me terribly the soundtrack with its whiny sound practically shoving sadness down the throat of the viewer and the movie trailer showing some beautiful sceneries the theological musings of him and his wife and the enthusiasm of his best friends as they prepare for a battle against blind faith thus misrepresenting the movie completelybr br to put it bluntly if one were to remove the scenes of the movie trailer from the movie the result would be a non descript family drama about a little child dying and the hardships of her parents as a result clearly not what i expected from a movie about darwin albeit the movie was beautifully interpreted
