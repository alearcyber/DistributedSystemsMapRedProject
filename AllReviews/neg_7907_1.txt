NEG frankly i did not think there was anything humorous about this movie it was really lame and poorly done with no plot whatsoever surprisingly it got some chuckles from me at the beginning with the malcolm x terminal and that was about it seriously soul plane made even the worst movies such as gigli look like a emmy winner this movie is really not worth seeing unless of course you were blind like johnny witherspoon who played the blind man in the movie another sad character i cringed at majority of the stereotypic jokes and ruining tom arnold and dl hughley by casting them in this movie this movie could be summarized in just one sentence nashawn wins  and creates his own airline sex drugs homosexuality more sex drugs did i mention sex if i could i would rate this movie in the negative integers however the beginning was amusing which brings this movie to a  doing the t bag pfft
