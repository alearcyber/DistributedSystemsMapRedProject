POS a ghost story on a typical turkish high school with nice sound and visual effects taylan biraderlertaylan brothers had made their first shots on a tvshow a couple of years ago as far as i know that was kind of a turkish xfiles they had very nice stories but lacked on visual effects this time it seems they had what they needed and used them well this movie will make you laugh thats for sure and as well it might have you scared it has a nice plot and some young bright actors in it if you are a high school student in turkey you will find so many things about you here there are many clues in the movie about its story and ending some you understand at the moment some will make sense afterwords the dialogs were written very cleverly so these make the movie one of the best turk movies made in the last years do not forget this movie is the first of its kind in the turkish film industry
