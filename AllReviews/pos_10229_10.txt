POS as an avid reader of clive barker i truly anticipated this film prior to its release i was not let down nightbreed is a horse of a different color rich in the underlying decay of western civilization and dripping with alternative existence in a way we have never seen before barker is at his best when he allows us to peek into his world of unprecedented horror yet showing us the other side of the coin here the monsters are the hideously beautiful beings while the humans are the deceptively ugly creatures of self indulgence we soon learn that we were wrong all along by far my favorite performance by the often underused craig sheffer and the added bonus of david cronenberg as decker is a cast best seen then believed the monsters are portrayed flawlessly by a bevy of english creature masters whom many also brought the cenobites to life in hellraiser including pinhead himself doug bradley nightbreed is an absolute must see for any fan of the horror genre and anyone who needs just a little something more out of their horror story this is clive barker at his finest
