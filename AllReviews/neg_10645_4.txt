NEG theres lots of ketchup but not a whole lot of sense in the supposedly explanatory third sequel which piles on the naff visuals to no effect good old alan smithee directed this one in which various members of the same family all played poorly by bruce ramsay are terrorised by pinhead doug bradley wheeled out of mothballs for the umpteenth time peter atkins tries to imbue his script with poetic touches but doesnt seem to realise that his dialogue is as deep and meaningful as a plate of sick the incoherent plot fails to adequately fill the movies meagre running time although this may have more to do with studio interference than anything the filmmakers intended
