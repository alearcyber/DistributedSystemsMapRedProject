NEG i have seen many japanese horrorfilms and i have to say that some of them are really interesting but they are all pretty much the same this one is no exception the ghost is a black haired girl that scares its victims by doing nothing else than walk and look dead the difference is just the motive for the haunting the rest is the same as every time black haired girl strange things happening with some media photos creepy acting while watching this flick i constantly found myself asking why i was wasting my time watching stuff that someone else has done so much better before some scenes where quite nice though ill give it  out of
