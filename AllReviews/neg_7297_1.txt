NEG looking for a movie for your turkey film festival the roller blade seven is on my list of the ten worst films of alltime the plot the story of a postapocalyptic roller blading samurai warrior is a convoluted hodgepodge of film references of everything from star wars to the seven samauri the acting fluctuates from bland to abysmal the scene where the villain tempts the old master is embarrassing to the point of jeering laughter frank stalones black knight reminds one too much of john cleeses black knight in monty python and the holy grail word of advice frank when you stoop to doing a movie like this one your career is over i chanced upon this little stinkbomb on a lowend cable channel and i could not stop watching it is like watching a train wreck you just cant look away
