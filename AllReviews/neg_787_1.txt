NEG this is my first review on imdbcom and probably first ever written review of a film ive done of my own accord  not for some class assignment i think that fact alone says something about this movie not a good thing i am no seasoned journalist or critic though i have seen my fair share of movies but i found this particular film so terribly painful to watch it was necessary for my own peace of mind to vent about the experience where better to do it than imdb as i forced myself to sit through the movie physically writhing from the inability to connectthedots i was sure there would be some light at the end of the tunnel  a revelation to explain what in samhell was going on the movie ended and i was as enlightened as dog after several rewinds to review certain scenes i still could conclude nothing sensible i found myself wanting to yell does this make sense to anybody i would recommend to not waste your time but then again if i were you id probably want to experience it myself if thats the case bring a crossword puzzle or something so you dont get bored
