NEG i saw this one remastered on dvd it had a big picture of sandra on it and said starring sandra and made it seem like she had a big part in it not so shes barely in it she does what she can with the script but thats not much br br the sound was awful by that i mean things didnt go together shots would be fired and the number of shots didnt correspond to the sound people talking in a car while its moving and the shot is from outside the windshield but theres no motor noise road noise or any other sound kind of weirdbr br score was awful it sounded like the same few notes over and over dialog really awful br br acting was awful i couldnt believe any of it fight scenes were like a batman comic without the biff and bam they were really lame the shooting scenes i mean with firearms were laughable literally i fastforwarded through a lot of this movie even then it was too long
