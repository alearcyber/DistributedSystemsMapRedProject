POS style over substance but what a style it is the cell is the internal version of most serial killer movies unfortunately the story hardly supports the visualsbr br psychotherapist catherine deane jlo goes into her patients dreams via artificial means to discover and help them over come their phobias and obsessions a new patient whose fallen into a coma is brought to her attention by the fbi hes a serial killer who drowns his female victims then poses their bodies in grotesque scenarios like mannequins deane must enter the killers mind and navigate through his sick fantasies in order to find and save his latest victim br br director tarsem singh has incredible visions and set pieces for this production each dream sequence is like a nightmareish painting in motion from the landscapes to the costumes br br but the plot suffers from lack of history of its characters stargher is the only person with a thorough background and hes the last person you want to care about without him you basically have a movie that moves in the present tense only which is a shame since the movie is so visually stunning and genuinely scary lopez is wasted but shes not that amazing an actress anyway though shes as gorgeous as ever and vince vaughn i dont even know why he was chosen this is not his forte and he overacts to boot he tried too hard to become his character and it showed stick to comedy vince even so this movie is so visually frightening i still watch this movie with the lights on and can never fall asleep right away afterward
