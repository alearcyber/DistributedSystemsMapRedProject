NEG there is a lot wrong with this movie it can be said that doing a sequel to halloween was a bad idea in the first place and we should feel lucky that the previous entries even at their lowest were still watchable but even still halloween the curse of michael myers  even today  is so bad its shocking poor moviemaking at its worst indeed there is so much blame to go around but where to begin whose shoulders does this blame rest on br br was it director joe chapelles styleoversubstance directing well at the very least the sixth installment is fresh on the visual front and as far the visual effects go you get to see michael kill in some pretty gruesome ways even if it doesnt quite fit in with the overall tone of the seriesbr br so could daniel ferrands troubled script be the culprit well to be fair he did the best he could by the time you reach the sixth entry in any series youre running out of places to go finding a rhyme to michaels reason isnt a bad concept so much as its an uninteresting one especially the way its handled here and it really doesnt help that the movie was hacked to pieces and sewn back together so many times that the story got completely lost towards the endbr br perhaps dimensionmiramax could have botched the whole thing afterall this was the first studio film in the halloween series and we all know what happens when too many cooks get in the kitchen heck look at the unbelievable lows they dragged hellraiser to i guess everyone is to blame because aside from the actors and the visual effects guys it seems nobody put in the effort to deliver a decent flickbr br the bottom line though is that no matter how you cut it slice it dice it or electrocute it until its head explodes halloween the curse of michael myers was never a good film marking an alltime low for the series that nearly killed off any credibility for michael myers curse is just that cursed the thorn angle was never interesting nor was it probably expanded upon the needless gore is so out of place and replaces the tension that is the trademark of the halloween name towards the end the movie stops making sense stops trying to push a plot and simply tries to find a way to kill the characters and end the film before anything else is lost its sad that donald pleasences final performance is immortalized in this film even if the man did the best he could under the worst possible conditions and for the most part theres other strong castmembers in this film paul rudd plays the weird antisocial adult tommy doyle rather naturally while marianne hagan does a fair job at portraying the sympathetic female lead on the other side of the coin the recasting of jamie lloyd was a shame and thank god devin gardner doesnt do movies anymore as the child in the film being pursued by the man in black danny is the antijamie in that he is annoying whiny and absolutely unbelievable in his role its sad when you cant even feel sympathy for a child in a horror film but i guess thats halloween  in a nutshell essentially this is the antihalloween made by a director who didnt know what he was doing and a studio that had their own agenda hell even the music is bad many will try to paint this as the edgyhalloween because of its scifi twist but really its just stupid save for some good visuals and decent characters the curse of michael myers is just about as bad as it gets and this is coming from a fan
