NEG well theres a few things about this movie everyone should see it you see the nation of iraq like youve never seen it covered by the media and shot from a perspective that is hardly considered by most americans where the movie has its main audience however all that glorious stuff in mind lets take a look at a few other facts of the movie there were  cameras handed out to the iraqi people most all of which view the war and subjugation of the occupying forces as a growing pain for the bettering of their nation and in comparison to saddam it is simply a feeble scratching at the skin also netflix as its main distributor advertised it before the fun election we just had by sending out a mass email to its entire roster to see the film many of the what should be labeled as opinions played out as facts listed off by the interviewed iraqis are wrong if one is to review the red cross records of abu ghraib tortures it wasnt saddams henchmen who were being tortured it was a fine mix of a  innocent civilians and  rightfully detained people never was it disclosed that any of that  were saddams henchmen or curfew violators in addition the arab world really has never listed democracy as one of their opponents more correctly it is the usas  billion dollars a year to isreal our military bases in saudi arabia and our interest in oil i agree that the media is a complete distortion but this film shows that same distortion im afraid that the iraqi people that this film represents have been edited to speak with a yankee voice yes its true that saddam is a puke and that his removal many see for the best its true that some iraqis actually get paid a good wage just as its true that no iraqi people have control of their most prized oil and us corporations do nor does it mention that  civilians have died due exclusively to us artillery still  of the country which once had running water and electiricity now does not nor does it mention that from  un sanctions purposed and authored by the usa government killed over  iraqi civilians nor does it mention that democracy in when people decide the government not a massive war machine that sends the message be killed or obey i am afraid that the cutting room floor must have quite a bit of iraqis that arent so happy with the occupation just as the vast majority of the world was not for the war in fact the america britian spain and the rest of them are not carriers of democracy they turned their back to it when they saw how full their pockets could be hurray saddam is out of power but im afraid that no iraqi is yet in power corporations are in power the media is in power read do your own research and dont let them blindfold you
