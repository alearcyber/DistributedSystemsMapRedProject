POS kirk and the crew are visiting a federation mining colony on a remote planet rich in mineral resources the devil in the dark is the horta a very unusual silicon based lifeform which tunnels through solid rock the horta has been killing miners and it is decided must be destroyed but how br br it is hard to continue this review without writing a spoiler so instead i simply concentrate on the technical aspects of the episode and touch on its themes the special effects are ok but many of the scenes with the horta look a little absurd the acting is fairly average for tos some of the miners are a little awkward nimoy has the most difficult role of all in devil in the dark and he pulls it off well br br why is this still a favorite of minebr br devil in the dark is really an anthropological and ecological morality play disguised as an adventure more than many episodes of this great tv series it brings home the importance of maintaining an open mind and at least some degree of empathy toward others plus it involves one of the most interesting if not probable plot twists in the original series br br enjoy
