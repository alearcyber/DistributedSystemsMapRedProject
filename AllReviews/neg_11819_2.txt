NEG and youd be right black mama white mama also known as women in chains is exactly the kind of trashy and crappy bmovie that the premise suggests pam grier has been thrown into a prison on a small island with a lot of other women and this place seriously makes the summer camp where martha stewart is locked up right now look like a maximumsecurity prison its not five minutes into the movie that one of the hottie guards utters the line strip em and get em wet and then we are introduced to a prison life that resembles some college freshmans fantasy of what the inside of a sorority house is like br br the prisoners soap and rub and wrestle with each other in the shower like its a girls gone wild shoot then they all hang out together in their dorm openly smoking pot and discussing in a big group what would be the best ways to escape ive never been to prison myself but i have a feeling that escape plans are the kind of thing that you want as few people as possible to know about prisoners or guards or otherwise the biggest difference between this prison life and some fantasy sorority life is that the women in this movie all wear orange cardigans and no pants go figure that say prison on the back must be those generic prison outfits for prisons that cant afford pricey accessories like their prison name or prisoner numbers for their uniformsbr br and as is to be expected a prison that cant afford to put prisoner identification on the backs of the uniforms can obviously not expect to be able to find guards that are interested in guarding the prisoners as much as they are in having sex with the prisoners and each otherbr br the conflict of the movies title refers to the fact that lee daniels pam grier spends much of the time handcuffed to a blonde prisoner named karen as they are on the run from the cops after escaping from the prison i wont go into details about how they escape except to say that you might have seen something like it in the fugitive had they been unable to afford to stage a train wreck and it leads into the muddled story of the conflicting interests also chasing these two women for different reasons karen and lee both have their own gangs of people each hoping to rescue their respective escaped prisoner and the cops are after both of them all the whilebr br spoilers so karen is involved with a bunch of hippies that want to revolutionize life as they know it meanwhile karen just wants to get off the island something shes been trying to do for years and isnt it just perfect that they each need to go to completely opposite sides of the island in order to fulfill their goals so we get this odd couple pairing and since they are an odd couple its not hard to predict that they will hate each other for the vast majority of the film but grow fond of each other by the endbr br in a movie with so many conflicting interests especially when those conflicting interests not only propel the two main characters in opposite directions as they pursue their goals it is not unreasonable to expect that there will be a climactic moment involving the rival gangs at some point in the movie not about to leave anyone unsatisfied they throw in a stupid gang standoff at the end of the movie where everyone shoots machine guns at each other killing each other en masse while the two women paddle safely and calmly across the river in a little boat nice br br even better at the end of the movie after a huge massacre in which lots of people get shot and spurt bright red paint all over the place the captain of the police looks over the masses of dead criminals covered in awful awful special effects and we learn that he will be a major before dinner not a bad way to end the movie the criminals all kill each other off and the cops get all the credit but here is the last line in the film  its better to win isnt it br br is that why the captain is going to get promoted to major because he figured that out
