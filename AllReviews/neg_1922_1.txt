NEG spoilers spoilers here on earth    out of fourbr br mark piznarskis here on earth holds the record for a movie containing the most recycled material in  minutes literally every contrivance clich and familiar plot element are somewhere in here there is simply nothing unique original or fresh about it god what an agonizing motion picture to sit through i wish i saw the film during its theatrical release last year so it could have earned on my years worst list this is the kind of movie where the story makes itself instantly obvious and goes downhill from the opening credits and worst of all takes itself seriously here on earth is clearly one of the most horrible painful movies to come down the pike in some timebr br here on earth is a teen heartthrob film so it must contain some of hollywoods most prized young men who are attractive and inexperienced enough to accept a role in a movie as bad as this chris klein and josh hartnett fit that vary description and take the lead roles by storm klein plays kelley an arrogant and insolent student with a wealthy father clich number one he is to graduate as the valedictorian and attend ivy league college following in the footsteps of his father stuart wilson this sets up the i dont want your life clich in which the father tries to control his sons life while the son resists rebelliously throw in kelleys deceased mother who committed suicide a while back when his father brings home another woman he brutally questions his intentions the no one can replace mom clich counts as number twobr br josh hartnett plays jasper a character on the opposite side of society to kelley his family owns a local diner enter his longtime love interest samantha cavanaugh leelee sobieski a waitress at the diner who covers for her sister who has no purpose whatsoever rather than controlling the following scene when jasper and kelley act like childish morons by racing their cars and oh no crashing into the diner causing it to erupt into flames conflicts between the rich and poor will count as clich number threebr br the bungled car chase sets both kelley and jasper up for a contrived and plausible conflict they get in trouble with the law but because this movie feels the need to exist the local judge orders them an alternative to serving time they must work together to help rebuild the dinerbr br the two boys work hard during the summer growing strong and getting a nice tan samanthas eye catches kelley and romantic sparks fly jasper is jealous but wants what is best for his true love clich number four her parents annette otoole and bruce greenwood disapprove of her little romantic triangle clich number five but she continues two timing jasper without a second thought her father also happens to be the local sheriff how surprising lets count that melodramatic nugget clich number sixbr br the contrived romantic feelings between kelley and samantha count as clich number seven but samanthas relationship with jasper is never defined so how can there any romantic tension if the film is going to induce involvement in samanthas choice between the two young men then we need to see both characters from both sides the movie depicts jasper as a distraction to her rightful love kelley its clear jasper truly loves her but it is also clear she does not love him back this absolutely slaughters the romantic tension early in the storybr br leelee sobieski does no harm here however her charm and kind performance do not fit a twotiming character like samantha john hartnett is also right for the role of jasper but the movie gives him nothing to do except bicker with kelley chris klein gets to make a hunk name for himself here he spends much of the movie shirtless sweaty and overworked unfortunately he does not show off his acting ability maybe because he has very little the supporting cast is much more talented bruce greenwood supplies the best performance in the film but does not have near enough screen time to save anything but a few brief moments i also enjoyed the performance by stuart wilson who perfectly fits the role of a rich controlling father of high social statusbr br then we lean about samanthas knee problem exactly one hour and ten minutes into the movie another spoiler ahead what is this she has a serious incurable illness yet another contrivance into the picture approximately number eight her terminal disease brings the two competing young men together as friends well at least i think that is what the movie intended to show that the loss of one loved by two nemeses can bring both together clich number ninebr br klein rehearses his valedictorian speech to demonstrate his character is more than a shallow stereotype but we have seen this so many times before i would prefer a rich character rather than a deeply sentimental who hides actual feelings clich number um was it ten the conflicts between kelley and jasper are desperate and inane a your mom comment triggers a fist fight while they rebuild the establishment there is a retread from armageddon as samantha and kelley sprawl out in an open field horny as hell as he slowly moves his fingers around her body naming areas after us cities why not call that number eleven the movie uses alcohol as a means to increase the romantic tension an intoxicated kelley makes a fool of himself after getting in a fight with samanthas date jasper but the following day he recites desires only to dance clich number oh no i am losing count
