NEG certainly not a bad little low budget film this bride of the gorilla but nothing special neither and not memorable enough to be ranked among the meaningful scifi efforts of its time director curt siodmak was an eminent scriptwriter during the s and s and delivered stories for some true genre classics i walked with a zombie the wolf man but as a director he obviously lacked the required competences bride of the gorilla is similar to the aforementioned the wolf man in story and atmosphere but the film looks a lot more amateurish and pitiful both handle about cursed men that turn into large animals at night but the titular gorilla doesnt look half as threatening as the werewolf even though the film got released a whole decade later during a cheesy opening speech actor lon chaney tries to convince us that the jungle is an ominous place and hiding many mysteries but actually theres no real mystery in the plot its just handles about a plantation manager whos jealous at his older colleague for having such a beautiful young wife and he kills him a native woman witnesses his crime and puts a spell on barney that causes him to transform into a hideously big gorilla at night or maybe she just wants him to believe hes turning into a hideously big gorillalon chaney himself plays the police commissioner charged with the murder investigation while raymond burr who starred in about a thousand perry mason tvmovies portrays the greedy plantation managernightly gorilla siodmak attempts to make the film look like a supernatural thriller  is it or is it not all just happening in barneys head  fail miserably and it causes way too much talking and too few jungleaction several of the junglesettings are nicely pictured but the rest of the special effects are tacky and poorly done still the acting is pretty good barbara payton is looking beautiful and  although very predictable  the story is strangely compelling until the very end weird movie it probably voodoocursed me
