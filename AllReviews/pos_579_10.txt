POS this wonderful movie captures so many elements of what makes a family comedy funny entertaining sweet and memorable its difficult to decide where to startbr br from the opening number rainbow connection paul williamss excellent score sung with gusto by kermit d frog which gives us a prologue of what the whole adventure is about throughout the story this is one fun moviebr br essentially its a road trip movie where kermit travels crosscountry with a dream of pursuing a rich and famous contract to entertain along the way our green hero meets a series of other aspiring actors comedians singers and musicians who coincidentally are muppets like kermit himself is this how the muppets really started approximately how it happened kermit tells usbr br not since its a mad mad mad mad world has the cameo formula been used so prolifically and successfully the aspiring stars encounter many recognizable faces during their odyssey some just blink across the screen but others have very memorable cameos steve martins amusing bit as a rude waiter is probably the best puppeteer jim hensons nod to his inspiration edgar bergen is especially touchingbr br anyone who ever watched the muppets tv show will get to see all of their favorite characters theyre all here the puppetry work is magnificent look especially for kermit riding a bicycle how dey do dat injokes and references to old movies are everywhere but the best oneliners are reserved for kermit himself an example when the crooks are terrorizing kermit and piggy she affectionately says to her short green and handsome beau i wouldnt give up this evening together for anything would you uhhh make me an offer i also love the gunfight at the ok corral scene brilliantly absurd sillinessbr br gotta get movin right along now but to summarize a good natured movie that can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of age or movie genre taste highly recommended
