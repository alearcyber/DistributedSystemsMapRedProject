NEG this movie is bad so bad that my mother who can barely stand the suspense of disneys snow white was chuckling through out the entire movie my first warning shouldve been that it was in the  bin at walmart but i have actually found some good movies in that bin so i cant fault if for this debacle the second warning should have been that when the cashier rang up the dvd it was actually  again i have never been one to ignore the cheapies this movie is definitely not for people looking for something good to watch and it most certainly isnt for everyone that enjoys the occasional bad movie if you need background noise while you are doing something like playing cards with some friends then get this but if you are looking for something to actually watch dont even bother it was really disappointing because there were a lot of good actors i felt like i was watching a chocolate version of willard
