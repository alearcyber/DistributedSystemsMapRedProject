POS dont watch this film while or soon after eatingbr br having said that begotten will stick with you for the rest of your life like it or not based on the nihilistic philosophy that life is nothing more than man spasming above ground to paraphrase the title sequenceintroduction this will more than likely contain the most intense and grisly imagery youll ever see in a filmbr br there is no dialogue only image after image describing the cycle of life the films combination of stark black and white photography compounded with some truly creepy background sounds work to drive home the makers messagebr br the movie begins with god portrayed as a bandaged and obviously insane man slicing open his torso with a straight razor and subsequently dying in his own filth after his death mother nature emerges from his corpse to impregnate herself with his blood and semen and gives birth to man represented by a maggot of a human convulsing on the earthbr br the landscape is a barren waste populated by hulking shrouded humanoids who eventually happen upon mother nature and man after a slew of violent scenes depicting the rape of nature and destruction of man these humanoids proceed to pound the remains of the corpses back into the ground and the cycle of life begins anewbr br i actually rented this from blockbuster one night based on the cover art and hype content but this is definitely not a blockbustertype film dont expect narrative dialogue or any pulled punches this is intense imagery based on a dark subjectbr br i give this movie some high marks for the filmwork and audio but i dont think ill be watching it too often if again i like my movies dark and unique but this one is exponentially more than i expected
