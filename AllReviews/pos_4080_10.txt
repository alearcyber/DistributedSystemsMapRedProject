POS if you are interested in learning more about this sort of thing happening in modern civilization there is an excellent book called outlaw seas or the outlaw sea and it describes in story after story how these things do happen the lawlessness of the high seas is a reality for a number of reasons one many of the worlds freighters are of questionable registry nationality and its difficult to impossible to enforce international laws when the ships owners dont have an office in a real country two many ship lines employ crews from dirt poor third world countries the crews are often like illegal immigrant workers threatened and bullied into complying with questionable or illegal practices three there is often a language barrier not only between the officers and the crew but also between the crew members themselves the crew are rewarded for their compliance and their silence four once committing an illegal act the ships are able to hide in plain sight with little more than a fresh coat of paint anyway its fascinating readingbr br horrifying story excellent movie does anyone else notice how hbo seems to make the best and most important movies hollywood has trouble releasing enough oscar worthy movies in any given year so that several of the top  contenders usually come from britain jerry bruckheimer  the end of quality cinemabr br i loved the thoroughly evil performance by sean pertwee i also as usual loved omar epps
