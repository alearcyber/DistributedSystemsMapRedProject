NEG the quick and the undead is finally the first movie to actually render its own storyline null and void it is essentially one gigantic plot holebr br aside from that the acting was quite bad character motivations nonexistent or unbelievable and there wasnt a single character worth hanging our hat on the most interesting cast member who had great potential to be a dark horse protagonist got snuffed halfway through the proceedingsbr br what the quick and the undead does serve as is an excellent example of how to do good colortiming it looked excellent when you take into account budget considerationsbr br unfortunately it plays out like a guy got his hands on a hundred grand and watched a few westerns most notably the good the bad and the ugly and then just threw a bunch of elements haphazardly into a movie you know they have movies where characters do this does it fit here no but who cares they do it in other movies so i should do it here br br maybe a good view for burgeoning cinematographers and colorists firstyear filmschoolers otherwise a mustmiss
