POS lifeforce is certainly one of tobe hoopers best films it has some great special effects and a lot of nudity so it seems like a typical horror fans dream the film is quit creative though and i think thats because of the script from dan obannon and don jakoby nice cinematography and a good creepy atmosphere make it a solid film
