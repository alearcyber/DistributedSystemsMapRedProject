NEG would somebody please explain why anybody would want to make a british neonoir crime film with a cast almost entirely american the accents spoken in this film are bloody awful but entirely in keeping with the performances which are so wooden one fears to strike a match for setting the cast on firebr br really what kind of disgusting moronic cynical crud is this even neonoir films have some character you either feel for or want to feel for even if theyre wretched and doomed they at least have some decency to them some sense that what theyve done is wrong or that a seemingly good plan has gone wrong and that somehow theyre stuck with the responsibility for itbr br not in this stanky stew these characters are putrid betraying each other themselves and the audiencebr br also note that they are lowlives  all right nothing wrong with that  except that they seem to be living a life of luxury for a film supposedly about desperate petty thieves the keynote here is  ennui its all so terribly dull and dross doncha know so lets just rip some people off or maybe murder them and go get laid in a luxury hotel what ambition br br gooping this whole mess to some bottom of swampy muck are boringly uneven pacing predictable action sequences that arent banal and incoherent setdesign madeforbadtv camerawork and editing forgettable score and an entire lack of any imagination or innovation in production and directionbr br wholly unbelievable unlikeable and for less dedicated movie watchersor masochists like myself utterly unwatchablebr br there are other nasty things i would like to say about this nasty film but they wouldnt print them here suffice it to say you can probably find something more useful to do with your time than watch this film  just about anything in fact
