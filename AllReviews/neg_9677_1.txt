NEG how this film could be classified as drama i have no idea if i were john voight and mary steenburgen i would be trying to erase this from my cv it was as historically accurate as xena and hercules abraham and moses got melded into noah lot abrahams nephew lot turns up thousands of years before he would have been born canaanites wandered the earthreally what were the scriptwriters thinking was it just ignorance i remember something about noah and animals and lot and canaanites and all that stuff from sunday school or were they trying to offend the maximum number of people on the planet as possible from christians jews and muslims to historians archaeologists geologists psychologists linguists as a matter of fact did anyone not get offended anyone who had even a modicum of taste would have winced at this one
