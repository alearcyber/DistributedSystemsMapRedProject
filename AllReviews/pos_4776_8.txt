POS created in  and originally named mortimer before walt disney changed his name because his wife convinced him mickey mouse has become the staple of the disney brand i always thought this cartoon was the first ever cartoon to feature mickey it is in fact his third but it doesnt matter for a six minute animated short it is enjoyable the story sees mickey piloting a steamboat until captain pete takes him off the bridge stopping to pick up cargo and minnie mouse missing the boat being lifted on she drops her music sheets and a goat eats them mickey helps her crank its tail and play the tune and getting some other animals to be percussion until pete comes along again to stop him making mickey peel potatoes mickey mouse was number  on the  greatest pop culture icons and he was number  on the  greatest cartoons very good
