POS to view the fictionalized biography the phenix city story i claim is to enter fields where us filmmakers have seldom ventured director phil karlson got his directorial assignment on the untouchables tv megahit series largely on the basis of kansas city confidential and this film and it has become one of the most admired and most imitated movies ever made the rarest feat for us filmmakers seems to be the herocentered purposeful anticrime film or tv series i remind the viewer how mightily cains hundreds and hardcastle and mccormicks and even the untouchables producers had to work to produce anything but episodes devoted largely to the unfictional activities of criminals rather than those of their ethical opponents this powerful seminal and verygritty movie has a style all its own and its lesson seems to be attention to detail about the opponents and victims of criminal organizations as well as their gang members there is a twelveminute prelude to the film in which reporter clete roberts interviews the real participants from the alabama citys who had struggled against its corrupt vice gangs the problem grew out of the presence of fort benning across the river and the nearly centurylong existence of vice dens in the area the film details the return of john patterson from germany where he has been a prosecutor his father defeated for attorney general of alabama refuses to join his pursuit of the th street vicelords despite several provocations including a beating of his son avenged by patterson on his tormentor there are several welldeveloped characters including ellie who works in one of the clubs and her honest boyfriend the leader of the syndicate the pattersons and johns wife ed gage the vicelords operatives and zeke ward an honest black man victimized for his opposition to them the cinematography by harry neumann and the art direction by stanley fleischer are in bw and are very much like newsfilm adding to the films realistic power music by harry sukman contributes to the film effectively writer daniel mainwaring and crane wilbur produced a swiftpaced and straightforward story that divides into parts part one illustrates the vicelords empire from inside one of their clubs showing the fate of a victim who is beaten and then picked up by police in the pay of the mob in part two albert patterson refuses to oppose the leader of the mob the intelligent rhett tanner in part three young patterson returns and after several incidents including his having to beat up the mobs head goon to avenge his own beating decides to run his father for attorney general of the state his wife is horrified and the mob kills zeke wards daughter and dumps the body at pattersons house with a warning his children will be next a few more such incidents including the loss of a trial in which the pattersons prove the goon killed a friend of theirs who had found the car implicated in the murder of the little girl and watch the inquest declare the death accidental convince patterson to run and he wins the democratic statewide nomination despite the mobs statist tacticsand is promptly assassinated john patterson stops a vigilante crowd from starting open warfare with the th street mob and uses their voices to call the capital and demand martial law for phenix city the clubs are closed and equipment confiscated but not before the girl inside is murdered by the mobs goon and patterson has to be stopped by zeke ward from killing tanner instead of delivering him to the law the dramas ending is upbeat but the prognosis for the town is less sanguine than painted the mob in fact tried to come back then moved to tennessee in this wellacted classic of anticrime filmmaking richard kiley is young but very strong as patterson playing it without an accent john mcintyre as his father is very good while edward andrews as boss tanner is award caliber others in the cast include kathryn grant as the girl inside ellie jean carson and kathy marlowe as the mobs women john larch as their goon biff mcguire as the young victim james edwards as zeke ward lenka peterson as johns wife and some good character actors as townsmen and mob bosses it is i suggest hard to say enough good things about the realism and lack of posturing in this film it is certainly one of phil karlsons best directorial efforts karlson also did the scarface mob later did walking tall as well a sobering and inspiring look at the ease with which complacent citizens of a publicinterest democracy can acquiesce to tyranny and how a few honest men can teach them the need to fight for their rights
