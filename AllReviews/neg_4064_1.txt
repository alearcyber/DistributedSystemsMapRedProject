NEG maybe this movie was actually intended to be satire like airplane but it failed at that as miserably as it failed at being a thriller i dont understand why they couldnt have paid an actual pilot a couple hundred bucks for a little technical advice hell i would have done it for free this magical aircraft managed to morph from a  to a  to a  in an hour and the power levers worked backward and the dialog sounds like it came out the back end of a kids game of telephone where everyone spoke different languages i actually rewound the tivo and watched some of it a second time to see if it was really as bad as i thought at first it was
