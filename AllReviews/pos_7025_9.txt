POS i didnt understand what that line meant i do now i didnt really want to see dirty dancing either id rented it out but never watched it  and today i did and i thought it was a really fun great movie that makes you want to get up and dance alright it was cheesy at times but its still a great movie i cant believe jennifer grey was  in this movie  my friend and i thought she looked about  or    at the most i guess this is attributed to her acting talent and she did really look awkward at times patrick swayze is also very good but you can tell he is in his thirties and seems a bit old nevertheless still very good i love s songs so it really struck a chord with me and the love story yes im a romantic was so wonderfully done i thoroughly enjoyed this movie exceeded my expectations
