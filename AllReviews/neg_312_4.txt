NEG on halloween a town is terrorized by a lunatic with a big pumpkin for a head bad acting compromised mostly of local talent and laughable special effects makes this one baaaaad bmovie queen linnea quigley looks embarrassed to be a part of this one and even her considerable charm which has helped so many of her other films cant help this one pass this cheesy flick if you are looking for a good halloween horror film and rent night of the demons which also stars ms quigley
