POS it is an interesting fact that metaphysics by platon and aristoteles formal logic and abstract ontology form about those sciences that most people are not interested in but then around one thousand years after aristoteles the computer began to usurp the human thinking and the humans who were refusing to reflect questions of being other than biological physical and chemical ones suddenly felt paralyzed because they could not cope with the consequences that this computers would bring over night rw fassbinders welt am draht together with tarkovskys solaris and godards alphaville is probably the first movie who took the philosophical questions of emerging computer science as a basis of a story to be told in a movie the confusing questions about identities and realities are cleverly built into different interwoven criminal stories which the audience really tries to follow because it is interested to solve the cases fassbinder was a master to sell highly abstracts contents to his public by embedding theoretical knowledge into practical appetizing forms the basis problem to understand is that an identity defines a reality but on the other side a reality also requires identity in order to be perceived the idea of a person with multiple identities is known to us solely from the standpoint of psychiatry however logically spoken the only reason why we have just one identity is the fact that our logic has only two values right and false now take a logic with just one more value ie with three then as you can easily see you have already three identities what happens now when let us say dr stiller gets killed then it is quite possible that only one of three identities is abolished and the other two remain and are able to rescue the individual from death another question is if a person with multiple identities actually feels these identities at once the idea however to display such sets of identities in a updown or downup way as shown in the scene with the elevator in the hotel is misleading since identities and hence realities are not structured in hierarchical but in a heterarchical way strictly speaking there is no artificial identity either since each identity is defined over two objects who share all of their features with one another therefore the idea of assuming that every individual has just one single identity is nothing but a consequence of ancient twovalued logic either a second identity would imply that a person at the same time exists and notexists but now look around and see that one and the same object which is by definition selfidentical is perceived by every subject in its own way if therefore every subject sees an object differently why should it no be possible for the single individual to open the borders of his twovalued individualitycorset with the effect that different persons can exchange their different individualities fassbinder would five years later pick up this topic in his masterpiece despair a trip into the light
