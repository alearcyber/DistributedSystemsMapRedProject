NEG what a sad surprisebr br being a diehard fan of the original series starring don adams i was really looking forward to this poor fool me this is sillier and more brain dead than a monkeys bottombr br to say it was bad would be a severe understatement it iswas the worst movie well first  minutes of one i have seen for a long time i couldnt stand more than the first half hour preferring to watch my hard drive defragmentbr br i can tolerate bad bad is ok sometimes even cute but up with contrived hollywood crap and this has to be the worst in many years i will not put this movie is a gross insult to the collective intelligence of humanity my five yearold daughter could have written better  and she is not even dislexic im really tempted to try watching the rest of it but im afraid i have better things to do like making pizza dough and watching it risebr br what a sad disappointment no im buggered off what a swindle as mel brookes once said piece of shirt
