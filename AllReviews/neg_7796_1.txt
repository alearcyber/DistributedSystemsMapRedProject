NEG think of the most unfilmworthy subject you can and this is  times worse a woman needs to complete as many crosswords as she can in a day we dont even get to see the questions and think of the words on our own we just watch her struggle the woman seems so anxious and in a hurry to do the crosswords but for some reason she spends the time distractedly walking all around the city when she could be focused at home the acting is horrible the actress huffs and puffs as she tried to think of the words and we are left completely in the dark the new york scenery is nice but the movie relies on it too much and it gets old fast the movie plays like a rejected nyu student film this film has no redeeming qualities and i do not recommend it to anyone ever
