NEG i dont understand jokes i do believe this is my problem with modern cinema or those films that are made with millions of dollars in hopes that it will become the next greatest sensation isnt it odd  people just dont laugh as much anymore and i do believe one of the diseases to that problem is the film showtime there was absolutely nothing from the beginning to the end of the credits with all of the bantering between murphy and de niro with russo as eye candy with even standard clichs which make the general population swoon with preprogrammed laughter there was nothing in this film that made me laugh there werent the overbearing physical jokes or the calculated mental vocal jokes at all throughout this debacle of a film from the beginning i didnt buy the matchup of de niro and murphy as anything more than hollywood excitement throughout the commentary the director vividly talks about the hijinks and laughter going on during the shoot  where was it in the film this falls to either two problems  the director really doesnt have a sense of comedy or the editor didnt understand the value of the film either way they both doomed the entire hour and a half spent on the hollywood nightmare showtimebr br outside of finding no reason to laugh there was no reason to follow these characters through any moment of the film there was a glimpse of humor with de niros desire to pick up pottery as a hobby but the director had to write kiln on the machine so audiences would understand  who does that but that was dropped and never developed there was the idea that murphy was an actor but outside of that one opening monologue nobody would have understood that he rents a room in a producers house in which he can afford on a police officers salary this just didnt compute even for hollywood standards there was a bad guy who wanted a big gun but the gun was never developed nor was there any true test of the weapons capability  even at the end it became a bigger joke to laugh at an accent than remember the guns where was the television show in this russo had to get permission from this random guy at the beginning but there were no consequences there was nothing in the middle of this film outside of further questions and meaningless dribble random characters were introduced forgotten reintroduced and forgotten all over again the director and producer laughed at this while we the meager viewer must suffer through inside jokes and clich stereotypesbr br was there a love interest in this film was there a truly sinister bad guy that went apart from the comic duo to bring true evil to the screen were there any pop culture references that didnt come back to robert de niro was there random chaos throughout this film if you need the answers to these obviously you wont find them in showtime the fact that i am riddling this review with question upon question only means that this subpar actually well below subsubsub par filled no quota or resembled anything of value to the cinematic world sure it had big names and one really neat explosion but there was nothing of substance to this at all it was almost as if the director said prior to the shoot that he wanted clichs but not regular clichs  go with the bad ones the plot had no linear structure the jokes were boring the characters were drab and underdeveloped this ranks below even the best of buddycop films i like to give films the benefit of the doubt but nothing worked in this film not even shatner could save this film and he even tried hardbr br overall i cannot nor will i suggest this film to anyone with a pulse the commentary only confirms the pathetic nature of the film with obvious flaws horrid jokes and creators questioning the validity of their work if creators cant stand behind showtime why should we i didnt want a lethal weapon when i watched this but i did want something like that i understand there was some form of criticism of reality television and the corrupt nature of the media but that message didnt make it off the page in fact i believe i saw media leave the theater first when i watched this shame carries its heavy hand with this film and i cannot blame it murphy used to be a big star comedy was his middle name see coming to america but lately he seems to have lost his edge de niro obviously wants to get away from an image that haunts him but making these sort of films is only going to set him back further one of these films is equal to one scorsese picturebr br skip this one i promise it will make your final cinematic days worthwhile oh and if you laughed at any of the jokes in this film  i am truly sorry br br grade  out of
