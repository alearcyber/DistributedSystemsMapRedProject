POS some critics have compared chop shop with the theatrical releases of city of god and pixote ive seen both of those as well as chop shop and like in many instances i dont feel the comparison is warranted city of god and pixote surely had a much higher budget chop shop is a low budget independent film about survival and hope disappointment and continuing with life one of the scenes is allegedly filmed during the us open and either the filmmakers had incredible connections or the scene was filmed at another time and the us open footage was added i say that because i live in the area where this movie was filmed and security is insane while the tennis matches are in progress its also noteworthy that the actors actual names were their characters names in the movie back to the movie its an enjoyable story about survival however it ended up getting a  because at times the actors acted extremely well at other times they appeared to be just reciting their lines if the actors were less competent as they were in the low budget the big dis for example i would have been more forgiving but in several scenes each and every one of these actors gave exemplary performances at other times they appeared bored the director might be at fault here i also had problems with the ending this is one of those movies that just ends maybe there will be a part  definitely worth getting on dvd i wont bother summing up the story because that info is already available on imdb
