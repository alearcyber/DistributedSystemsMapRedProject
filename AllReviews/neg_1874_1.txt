NEG you know as you get older you somehow think the movies you did not like when you were younger might have been because of your youth and inexperience case in point when i saw the godfather at age  i thought it was boring  years later its an incredible movie to me in other words i grew up and began to appreciate great moviesbr br so i rented dirty dancing with my girlfriend last night on her request as she loved it at age  and i hated it at the same age but i hoped because i was young and stupid at age  perhaps this would be a new experience for me so i sat down with her to watch hoping to be enlightenedbr br well the night after watching dirty dancing i feel a violation i feel like someone reached into my soul and robbed me of  hours of my life from watching this cheese festbr br first patrick swayze plays a  year old but he looks like he is  and the premise of the movie is him seducing some underage teenager wooing her with his dance moves really creepybr br anyway the movie is the clich plot where the wrong side of the tracks guy and the rich smart girl accidentally fall in love with each other of course their romance is fueled by the fact the rich girl cant dance a lick so the poor hero teaches her in a week to become an expert dancer for the big end of vacation show or something like thatbr br but you guessed it the disapproving father soon enters and forbids the two to see each other and the movie progresses to secret meetings of dance lessons and love making this all culminates into the final scene where the entire resort rallies around the two young lovers while the once antagonistic father accepts the  year old dancer as his teen daughters new manbr br even my girlfriend whimpered at the end of the movie as she admitted it was not anything like she remembered i didnt press her but i did smirk a little and put the godfather part ii in the dvd player
