POS i was unlike most of the reviewers not born in the s i was born on may th  despite this my life was very much in the style of the s when other kids had playstations i was playing zelda on my nes etc now this movie holds a special place in my heart already despite me being only  years old at the time of writing this review i because of my s style early childhood watched many tv shows and saw many movies that other kids didnt see and this movie was one of those and one of the greatest toobr br it starts off in the los angeles home of alvin seville simon seville theodore seville and david seville david the chipmunks adoptive father is in a rush to get to the airport as he is going on a business trip around europe his taxi is almost there and the chipmunks help him pack while they are talking alvin expresses his will to come with dave and to see the world even though technically dave is only going to europe so to alvin apparently only america and europe qualify as the world david is leaving the chipmunks in the care of miss miller much to the displeasure of the boys soon dave is off to the airport and the chipmunks are left at home with miss miller later at a local caf the chipmunks are playing a game of around the world in  days against the chipettesbrittany jeanette and eleanore after losing the game to brittany after having his hot air balloon eaten out of the sky by a crocodile alvin gets in an argument with brittany about who would really win a race around the world two diamond smugglers sitting at a nearby table klaus and claudia furschtien overhear their argument and needing a safe way of transporting their diamonds over the world decide to fool the children into delivering them for them they set up a race around the world where each team will have to deposit a doll in their own likeness secretely filled with diamonds at drop offs around the world and receive a doll in the opposing teams likeness secretely filled with the payment for the diamonds to varify that they were there the winning team would then receive a  dollar reward they do this because they believe that jamal an interpol agent who has been hot on their heels for some times now would never suspect them because they are just kids however this seems to be redundant because on their travels the kids do not have to go through any security checks and are never even questioned about the dolls i suspect that neither would klaus or claudia if they had taken the diamonds there personally and so begins a great adventure this film is a classic and i see no reason why anyone would not like it it features great animation and topnotch voice acting not to mention the kickass music pardon my french p my favorite song is without a shred of doubt the girls and boys of rock and roll an amazing rock song that cannot be topped its also my favorite moment in the film other notable songs include getting luckykind of suggestive for a kids film eh and my mother as well as wooly bully and off to see the world not to mention the main theme of the movie heard during the opening credits performed by the royal london philharmonic orchestra the scene with my mother still brings a tear to my eye in relation to the song getting lucky i first didnt think anything of it but when i grew older and learned about life it became clear that that song was a little bit suggestive that song along with the fact that the animators insist on the audience knowing the color of the chipettes panties this is especially apparent in the scene in egypt when the chipettes are being chased by the arabian princes men when eleanor leans over the side of the hot air balloon basket and her skirt defies gravity completely while this does nothing to draw from the overall quality of the film its one of those unexplained things like why nobody in the world seems to mind that there are feet tall chipmunks walking around and speaking in incredibly highpitched voices and treat them just like they would any human child anyway a bit after that scene the chipettes discover the diamonds in the dolls and decide to go find the chipmunks and get home the direction of janice karman perfects this movie as she and her husband ross bagdasarian jr know the characters better than anyone they even do the voices of the chipmunks and the chipettes ross doing the voices for alvin and simon as well as dave and janice doing the voices for all the chipettes and theodore speaking of male characters that are voiced by female voice actresses nancy cartwright the voice of bart simpson makes an appearance in this movie she plays the part of the arabian prince a very small but important role the ending is of course a happy one the crooks have been caught the loose ends tied and the film ends when the children dave and miss miller are driving into the sunset alvin complaining about not having gotten his  dollar reward for winning the race which annoys dave until he finally yells alvin and the screen fades to blackbr br classic ending by the way i hope you found my review of this movie useful and if you havent seen this flick give it a watch its worth the money this nostalgic classic from the s gets a solid  out of  br br headin for the top dont you know we never stop believing now
