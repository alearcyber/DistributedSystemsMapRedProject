NEG this is one of those strange selfimportant selfindulgent movies which tries too hard to be profound it isnt instead it spouts cliches that try to pass for profundity typical is the scene where peter kelsey grammer explains to protagonist and best friend adam dwier brown how man starts life breast feeding then moves on to sucking the breast of his girlfriend and finally his wife thus concluding ultimately that life sucks so deep we are treated to a variety of characters who offer their perspective of life the universe etc during adams travels through the mojave desert on foot he abruptly leaves la the day of his wedding and his family friends and fiance assume hes dead when his car was found in a military test range smashed by a rocket some characters are more entertaining than others the best by far is an escapee from a mental hospital who only speaks through the voices of others the actor james kevin ward does some great impressions including nicholson popeye and several characters from the original star trek but once the interesting characters leave the screen were stuck with adam again and his pursuit of the profound its a long trip which drags in many places in fact its the longest hour and a half movie ive ever seen and the finale hardly makes it seem worth while at allbr br i discovered this movie playing on hbo one day by waking up too early and clicking on the tv thatll learn me next time ill try harder to sleep in
