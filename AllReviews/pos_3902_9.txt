POS coscripted by william h macy from arguably donald e westlakes best and hardest to find novel a travesty very faithful to the story the movie stars macy as a hapless man who gets in way too far over his head after attempting to cover up an accidental death costars adam arkin and james cromwell in good supporting roles the strength of the movie is in the intricate twistaftertwist storyline and in the acting particularly by macy who routinely and delightfully breaks through the th wall here and gets away with it every time a good storyline with much dark humor this one engaged me enough that ive watched it three times in the week since it came out prepare to shelve your critical faculties and emit a loud bipartisan wheeeeee
