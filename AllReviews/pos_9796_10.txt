POS where do i begin i first saw this film in  and had no idea of what to expect i was actually at the time searching out films that elijah wood had starred in and this one had come highly recommended i sat down and watched the film once and didnt know what to think i watched it a second time a few days later and the floodgates just opened never before in my life had i ever really cried while watching a film and i was blubbing every high and low the film i was riding right alongside on an emotional roller coasterbr br it struck such an emotional chord in me on many levels the intense sadness and elation we see in the film the wonder and innocence of childhood the yearning for a time that once was but is no more more than anything this film reminded me of my childhood except for the abuse during a time in my life when id shrugged off my childhood some years before and not even really noticed id given it up and moved on to a life entirely devoid of it the radio flyer made me wake up and suddenly realise what id given up without really even noticing from that day forward i immediately set about to change my life and myself and i didbr br this is going to sound corny but basically i rediscovered my inner child i started down a path that has been ongoing over the past  years and has changed me so much so much for the better embracing and living that part of myself ive been finding out who i really am i dont think it was simply a case of the right film coming along at a crucial moment of my life the radio flyer really did something very special and i still look upon it as an incredible piece of work in all respects an incredible filmbr br in closing i cannot fail to mention the music i am a great fan of hans zimmer and this is among his very finest works the sheer breadth and depth of emotional expression he has put into the score of this film is a huge part of what makes the film what it is to me like subtitles to a foreign language film his soaring music is a crib sheet to the intense emotions this film will take you through find the soundtrack at all costs it was sadly deleted long ago i never expected to find it but amazingly did after chatting with someone i met on a hans zimmer fansite guest bookbr br watch this film let yourself live the emotions dont get bogged in trivial nitpicking of the ending be that child again
