NEG first of all since im one of the people who never saw the mstk chopped up version of this movie i cant comment on thatbr br however i did see the original version of this movie on the scifi channel and i thought it was just as good as anything else on that channel in fact i thought it was one of their better offeringsbr br ive noticed in perusing the comments here that the people who write in detail about soultaker with a modicum of intelligence thoughtfulness and maturity tend to like at least a few things about this movie and rightly so in its original cut most reasonable people i think would probably rate it at least  or  stars out of  five is average to me and i think this movie is about average for a sci fi picbr br in contrast to the above ive also noticed that the reviewers who seem immature dull and flip and as a result come off as boneheads from where i stand are the same ones who cant find anything good about this movie and basically trash it without cause based mostly on seeing it chopped up and fricasseed on mstk or if they have seen both cuts it seems they were greatly prejudiced by the mstk viewing to begin with
