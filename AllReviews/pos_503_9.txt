POS for a brief moment the opening scene with traci lords and thebr br techno bar is incredible id probably follow her to my ultimate death too best vampire movie of all time but with a twist the fight scenes are awesome wesley snipes displays an athleticism you dont get to see every day and stephen dorff is impressive and very believable as an ambitious new recruit moving himself up the hierarchy by any means necessary great flick  wheres blade ii
