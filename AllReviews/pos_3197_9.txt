POS awww i love this the tale of the cat and the moon doesnt really need an synopsis as thats what it is the cat chasing the moon to a spanish poem its the artistry thats interesting in fact there was this animated short called the fan and the flower that was an academy award winner last year  yeah almost same thing which leads me to believe it might just be a rip offbr br but this is a really good short with stark black  white shapes shifting and transitioning into beautiful motion and poetic seduction if you believe cats are poetry in motion see this and youll believe it morebr br also it has such a touching endbr br polarisdib
