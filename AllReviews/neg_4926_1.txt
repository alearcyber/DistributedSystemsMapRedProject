NEG may nd someone clicked  nos and then proceeded to do  more on my previous  comments almost as funny as this turkeybr br may st br br as i write this im still very much under the impression of what must be the funniest thriller ive ever seen ive got a major case of the giggles but ill try and calm down its kind of hard to write when your nose spills snot and the mouth ejects sporadic drool onto the keyboard br br a pair of young women who just returned from a vacation take a ride on a shuttle bus a couple of young guys join them but the bus isnt really a taxi service its a kidnapping vehicle dont snicker its driver has been part of an organized white slavery gang who snatch young women from airports and theyve been doing it for five years dont laugh five years on the same airport without the police or even the fbi ever getting any wind of it no giggling please apparently dozens of women go missing on in the same exact place for years and years  and yet noone notices a trend is the fbi that incompetent the world of shuttle seems to consist of three types of people easily kidnappable blonds dumbcomatoseinvisible fbi agents and omnipotent psychotic gangsters who hate sexy blonds with tattooed behindsbr br the driver has barely stayed alive on this one mission and yet hes done this for  i repeat  five years without being killed or losing one of his limbs stop laughing did i mention that the driver is immortal need i mention it we all know that movie psychos have immortal dna you can stab them bounce them against the walls of a bus repeatedly caress them softly with a hammer prick nineinch nails into their ears hell you could stick a handgrenade into the average hollywood psychos mouth and hed still escape with only minor scratches no the driver is not satan or even a minor demon but just a regular hollywood psycho with better survival abilities than the biggest meanest sewer cockroachbr br the basic plot outline a guy loses all the fingers on one hand in a silly scene a magical bus that reads and obeys minds the passengers try to escape they fail they get hurt they sulk they argue they try to escape they fail they get injured they argue they try to escape they fail they get injured they try to escape they fail they try to escape the kidnappees manage to snatch the gun from the driver alas they do not kill him because the golden hollywood rule of gandhilike pacifism prohibits them from doing it no giggling one of the other passengers turns out to be part of the gang stop laughing he is played by an actor who studied in the rob zombiejohn travolta school of overacting  silly mugging he threatens rape later on one of the gals hits him with a crowbar over the head about a dozen times very hard only seconds later does he regain consciousness yep he survives immortal remember he gets killed a little later no idea how though he is not supposed to be killable the kidnapees argue they try to escape one of them escapes alas the psychos are just far too godlike in their powers not to recapture their prey the game starts all over again the passengers try to escape they fail they sulk they stare into the void they get hurt they try to escape they fail they get hurtbr br you get the picturebr br frankly i believe that a drugged heavily disorientated inebriated snail would have escaped these nincompoop captors with ease there were so many opportunities at one point these bumbling psychos remember five years even send one of the kidnapees into a grocery store she leaves a message to the police however yeah you guessed it this fictional fairytale us city has no policebr br and just as you thought the movie couldnt get any dumber  not even if luc besson and brian de palma joined forces to lend a hand with the script  it does the girls are kidnapped in order to be sent to some remote island and this is achieved by transporting them as cargo apparently this fictional america has no fbi no police  and no border customs either it does however have immortal criminals with more luck than twenty lottery winners one blond had her billionth chance to kill the driver and yet she failed how is it that victims in these dumb thrillers never try to finish off their immortal adversaries once they have them down on the floor and injured i guess i answered that one myself theyre immortal so why bother trying she must have thoughtbr br so why was one blond gassed to death and the other one boxed and shipped alive complete with a kittylitter box and the funniest photograph since demi moores primary school pictures could it be the tattoo i think they killed the prettier one but thats just me was her tattoo that ugly br br could it be that i dont care why should i search for logic in a movie made by imbeciles for imbeciles besides how can i even think straight when im laughing so hard half the timebr br naturally this being a stcentury horrorthriller the mobile phone doesnt work perhaps this invincible gang control not only the fbi the police and the customs but satellites in space toobr br do i have to spell it out there are far easier ways to kidnap people and far more intelligent people who should be making movies give an idiot a camera and hell lay an egg every single time that sort of answers the eternal riddle of which came first the egg or the birdbrained director
