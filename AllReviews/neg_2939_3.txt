NEG im rather surprised that anybody found this film touching or movingbr br the basic premise of the film sounded to me like an excellent if provocative idea for a movie about a rare sort of relationship but one if i can judge by the reallife examples ive known is extremely deep and lovingbr br however the film is cheaply scriptedpoorly scriptedand although it has a number of very prettylooking shots i didnt find it to be anything specialbr br probably the biggest problem is that it is far too short and poorlycomposed to give its audience time enough to invest emotionally in the characters we dont really care about any of them and so their stresses and obstacles dont really touch usbr br i think a remakefrom the screenplay upwith some character development by some really good writerscould improve it greatly it is instructive to compare this film with brokeback mountain which the screenwriters took to far loftier levels than did the author of the screenplayscreenwriters who were clearly conscious of how to write a classical tragedy and carried out their task with care planning and superb craftsmanship however people only seem to remake those films that dont need it youre not really missing anything if you skip this one i found it very disappointing indeed and it is only saved from getting a star from me by virtue of the daring and gumption it took to make a film on this sensitive subject
