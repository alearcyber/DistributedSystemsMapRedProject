POS one of the great tragedies of life is that disney is so very successful at everything that they do if they were not we might have more unique little gems of animation such as the curious adventures of mr wonderbird the story is that an evil king has usurped the throne of a place called upanddownland i could have the name wrong he is hated by everyone his favorite hobby is shooting birds and at some point in the past he presumably killed the wife of mr wonderbird a bird played with typical flair by peter ustinov leaving him with four young chicks to raise meanwhile we see that another of the evil kings hobbies is painting he has done three paintings in particular a self portrait a painting of a shepherdess which he has fallen in love with and a painting of chimney sweep of whom he is jealous one night the shepherdess and the chimney sweep climb down out of their paintings and run away together the self portrait of the king climbs down out of his frame as well and does away with the real king you think im making this up its the real plot and sends the royal police force after the young lovers mr wonderbird then assists the lovers in attempting to escape the kings forcesbr br the plot is wonderfully surreal and the setting upanddownland is an incredibly imagined place full of towering buildings accessible only by elevators its an equal mixture of the worlds of metropolis and  and the drawings of dr seussbr br watch it for a very unique viewing experience that doesnt fit the standard formula for most animated features
