POS has the drama suspense and character developments you would enjoy if you like drama that engages you and entertains as well as educatesbr br the writers know their material and it shows the direction is always engaging and not blase and the acting terrific why this show didnt win any awards tells me the powers that be in hollyweird dont know drama or much else for that matter br br there is a plot twist in this episode at the end was a complete surprise and was very well played out im glad it wasnt used as a shock scene for any climatic end to this series which would have been more typical and dull rent this series at once lets hope its brought back from celluloid extinction
