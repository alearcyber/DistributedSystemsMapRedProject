NEG no one expects the star trek movies to be high art but the fans do expect a movie that is as good as some of the best episodes unfortunately this movie had a muddled implausible plot that just left me cringing  this is by far the worst of the nine so far movies even the chance to watch the well known characters interact in another movie cant save this movie  including the goofy scenes with kirk spock and mccoy at yosemitebr br i would say this movie is not worth a rental and hardly worth watching however for the true fan who needs to see all the movies renting this movie is about the only way youll see it  even the cable channels avoid this movie
