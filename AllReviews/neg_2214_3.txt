NEG this is just about one of the dumbest things ive ever seen maybe not a worst movie ever contender but if you havent seen that many bad ones this could easily make your top ten worst list when you consider what was achieved in  with the original king kong youve got to ask yourself why anyone would stoop so low as to produce this debacle then taking it one step further and realizing that the quantum leap to star wars the following year achieved a new level in scifi entertainment this offering will make you laugh and cry at the same timebr br now let me ask you what would possess the professor peter cushing to bring along an umbrella as a prime piece of subterranean research equipment for the ride to the earths core ok so it was useful in fending off the parrottyrannosaur parrotosaurus in the early going but come on somehow i dont think this is what edgar rice burroughs had in mind when he wrote his tales of pellucidar he probably didnt have caroline munro in mind either as princess dia probably the only redeeming factor to this whole escapadebr br at least there was one bit of pseudoscientific explanation that i got a kick out of im always looking for one in films like this that would have to be how the sky at the earths core was really the underside of the earths crust explaining that ethereal pinkish glow but try as it might the story just couldnt hook me in a way to find anything at all interesting about hoojah the sly one or jubal the ugly one much less those goofy half man half pterodactyl creatures to paraphrase the good professor  you cannot mesmerize me im paying attention
