POS when i first heard that the subject matter for checking out was a self orchestrated suicide party my first thought was how morbid tasteless and then a comedy on top of that i was skeptical but i was dead wrong i totally loved it the cast the funny one liners and especially the surprise ending suicide is a delicate issue but it was handled very well comical yes but tender where it needed to be checking out also deals with other common issues that i believe a lot of families can relate with and it does with tact and humor i highly recommend checking out a must see i look forward to its release to the public
