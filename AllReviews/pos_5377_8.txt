POS i would probably say this was on a par with films like devils rain and that sort of film although this is probably a bit better made i love s horror and this has most of the elements that make up other movies i like so it was pretty easy to enjoy a family on their vacation stumble across a small town where the people seem to be gripped by some sort of hysteria seems like the children have been disappearing after an initial attempt to flee this place the family is somehow stopped on the edge of town and find their way back but not without first finding a house where the kids are gone and mommy and daddy are dead seems like we have a different kind of twist on a senior citizen community center in this town theyre all satan worshipers and they need the kids to renew their lives so they can continue on in their service i guess not that anyone seems too keen on giving up their kids for this enterprise this is fairly classy considering that its scary and creepy without buckets of gore or the loud startling events that try to make people jump in films today which seem to have replaced actual scares we have hank kimball alvy moore from green acres as tobey a sheriffs deputy that reads ufo magazines and lq jones as the sheriff and a very familiar character actor as the dad of the stranded family and strother martin plays the doctor who seems to be doing double duty unbeknown to his fellow townsfolk this is pretty good stuff but a tad on the confusing side sometimes but overall works pretty well  is recommended for fans of s horror  out of
