POS this is one of my favorite horror films of all time and i used to think it never really got its due that is until i read the glowing reviews here it seems many feel the same as i did when i first saw itbr br its a damn creepy film and ive spent most of my life watching creepy films ive always found dolls mannequins and such damn creepy check out the dolls in beyond the door and of course the great trilogy of terror and what about the magnificent twilight zone episode living doll hell dolls are creepy and tourist trap has some moments that will make your hair stand on the back of your neck all aided by an excellent soundtrack that just makes connors performance even more heartpoundingbr br i remember seeing the trailer to this film on late night tv and thing wow i gotta see that it was memorable and its one of the only trailers i remember seeing as a kid that creeped me out took me years to see it but it was a treatbr br stephen king also mentions this film in his danse macabre book and gives it a glowing recommendation pretty good companybr br this film will always be high on my list of mustsees its a real solid addition to the genre of the time and deserves place alongside the best of the s schlockers
