NEG this movie is a real shame not just for the plotthe empty performance of the characters it is for the lack of creativity from the director and all the crew this is maybe one of the worst movies of all timesand it is hard to believe that is the sequel of one of the most famous movies of the sbr br i am a great fan of the mask when i went to see this movie i was expecting to a movie with a good sense of humor a movie with a acceptable plot instead i saw a really bad copy of chuck jones and tex avery cartoons the movie was not funny even for my  years old sister so i wonderwhat was wrong new line cinemawas it trying to repeat the success of the first movie or was it trying to create another masterpiece like the lord of the ringsbecause if they did they were completely out of their minds
