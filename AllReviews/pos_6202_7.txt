POS i enjoyed this series but felt that the whole thing was let down by the sound recordingmixingbr br for whatever reason theyve had to employ an awful lot of whats called adr where the actors replace the original location sound with a rerecording of it in a sound boothbr br the reasons for doing this are usually due to problems at the location or because somebody screwed up somewhere in the sound production chainbr br it wouldnt be so bad if the adr was done well but at times its just plain distracting its not just the adr thats the problem  the sound mix just doesnt match up to the quality of performances and the picturesbr br id be curious to know what went wrong
