POS in post civil war america the president van johnson travels to dallas and is assassinated by corrupt officials and businessman interested in installing the vice president whom they can blackmail due to incriminating documents a gunman guiliano gemma convinced that his black friend is wrongly accused of the assassination aims to uncover the truth tonino valeri directed this fascinating if flawed film which obviously is an allegory for the kennedy assassination the film may wrongly present blacks as slaves working on plantations in texas but the film is nonetheless enjoyable and presents an interesting interpretation  that kennedys death was the result of a coup de tat which many americans could not accept at the time oswalds murder is replayed here as the black accused of the assassination is murdered by the men responsible on route to fort worth prison this moment in the film is more melodramatic than oswalds death with his various escorts shot down before his over the top death scene nonetheless this is definitely one of the more interesting and worthwhile spaghetti westerns worth a look
