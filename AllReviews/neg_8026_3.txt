NEG being a completely broke film buff with a house to furnish im a big fan of ikea my whole domicile practically is packed to the brim with the cheap particleboard stuff and you know how all those stylish household items at ikea have those funny namesa bookshelf called holika and a bathroom mirror called a grundtalwell it just adds to the whole eurocharmbr br like those interestinglynamed but horribly translated items on the shelves at ikea id like to provide a bit of translation to some of the reviews ive read about the swedishmade kraftverk  br br original comment for a low budget film this is pretty cool stuff it would be great to see what these guys could do on a hollywood budgetbr br translation the film stock is crappy the lighting is pedestrian the cinematography is uninteresting the sound recording is hollowbr br original comment david lynchesque scifi drama set in a strange forest town with equally strange characters br br translation these actors are acting for free the storyline is circular and tiring the ideas that undergird the flick desperately try to be existential but are simply mundane and the settings especially the interiors are dull and filled with ugly wallpaperbr br original comment the editing is welldone and the conservative use of computer graphics shows that compelling cgi effects dont have to come out of a hollywood studiobr br translation when youve got sketchy cinematography to begin with hide the imperfections by digitizing all of it onto a mac and blending vigorously for three minutes ingeniousbr br i took a chance on this dvd because im a sucker for independent films especially those that attempt to tackle the oftenexpensive and aweinspiring genre of science fiction i mean some of the best scifi flicks of all time have been realized with little or no budget spfx and specious actors take peter fondas ecowarningtimetravel flick idaho transfer for example a classicbr br but kraftverk  doesnt fit the category of carefullycrafted lowkey ideadependent scifi it relentlessly focuses on characters that dont do much and dont say interesting things it goes round and round in circles it is much too long this coming from a major tarkovsky fan worse its concept of reality shifting aliens is twilight zone fodder from  years ago its just not a wellmade film and i really wanted it to be dammitbr br however being the ikea fan i am i did make one groundshattering observation first anyone who has shopped at ikea knows how their tricky shopping carts workall four wheels being multidirectional the carts can spin a perfect  degrees and it takes some familiarity to handle them like a pro as any avid ikea shopper knows well ill be damned but one of the lead actresses in kraftverk  goes to some inkydinky grocery store in the middle of nowhere and what is she pushing around a multidirectional shopping cart so thats not an ikea invention after all but is yet another wonderful invention lets call it a tacklebee for the hell of it from the land of heidoo
