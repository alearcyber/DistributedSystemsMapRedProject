POS as with footprints  i became aware of this one purely by accident it was mentioned in a review of the libertine  which i researched when that film turned up on latenight italian tv as being in a similar vein incidentally i missed out on that screening of the libertine though i acquired it via the same channel later on but did manage to watch the film by way of a rental of the englishdubbed r dvd during my sojourn in hollywood in late early  actually in view of the enthusiastic reviews for it i was let down by the libertine  being too lighthearted in nature for what was essentially a serious theme the sadomasochistic relationship between a young couple to be honest for much of the time i was afraid that the frightened woman would go the exact same routebut was subsequently amply redeemed by a wicked if not exactly unpredictable final twistbr br the film concerns the freethinking social attitudes and dazzling creative arts prevalent in this era an eminent philanthropist philippe leroy invites a female journalist dagmar lassander at his fashionable home for the weekend however it transpires that hes a misogynist who distrusts all members of the opposite sex and would rather dominate or even kill them therefore for the first half of the narrative we see the heroine enduring pain and humiliation at leroys hands including being forced to make love to a dummy in his own imageuntil the tables are subtly but unsurprisingly turned she not only emancipates herself from his control but teaches him that man and woman can coexist harmoniously  except that lassanders following her own personal agenda as well br br the leads are perfectly cast and the film itself often darkly comic for those in the mood furthermore its greatly abetted by a typically effervescent eurocult score from the everreliable stelvio cipriani and the imaginative  even outr  look the giant structure depicting the lower section of the female form with a steeltrap where its sexual organ should be seems to emanate from freud incidentally this prop figured prominently in stills id seen previously from the frightened womanbut it barely registers in the film proper other bizarre touches include the preposterous radio program sexual aberrations and the stars and an idyll at a castle belonging to leroys family complete with secret passage through the wardrobe and a dwarfish manservant one of the highlights then is easily lassanders erotic dance virtually in the nude  an episode which actually spearheads the humanization of leroy eventually the two characters have a showdown in the latters pool  amusingly set to a spaghetti westerntype theme br br in the long run for all its stylishness the film emerges as inferior to the similar but much more extreme contemporaneous japanese masterpiece by yasuzo masumura blind beast  finally its worth noting that the frightened woman was distributed in the us by filmmaker radley metzgers company audubon films he would even employ its production designer enrico sabbatini for his own camille   to get to the edition i watched apart from the usual shortcomings in the englishdubbing department the presentation here was further marred by a rather washedout appearance and brief instances of distracting extraneous noise on the soundtrack by the way there seems to be some confusion with respect to the films runningtime its length given on various sources ranges anywhere from  to  minutes  all i can say however is that the copy i own ran for  minutes
