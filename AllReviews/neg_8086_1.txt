NEG this movie quite literally does not have one redeeming feature the characters are onedimensional cliched incredibly misogynistic and stupid the script looks as if it was cobbled together from  other movies the acting is horrible and some of the grossout humour made me feel nauseousbr br shame on you gregory poirier for thinking any of this would be funny or interestingbr br the worst movie ive seen in several years
