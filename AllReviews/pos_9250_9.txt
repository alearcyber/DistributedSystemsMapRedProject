POS i have always been a fan of the show so ill admit that i am biased when the shows run ended i felt like too many questions remained unanswered this movie to me felt like closure to see all the people id followed over the past few years together at last was most rewarding i have heard that this is probably the only homicide movie that we can expect if that is so this is the appropriate way to go out this movie is sometimes poignant sometimes upsetting but always satisfying if you are or ever have been a fan of the show watch this movie
