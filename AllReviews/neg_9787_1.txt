NEG i am appalled to see that so many people have given positive reviews for this film this movie has no redeeming factors the music is not good the acting is pathetic i have a difficult time understanding how someone could enjoy this movie let alone sing its praises the idea is horrible certain scenes linked to the plot such as the continued love story even though the male romantic interest is a shrunken head are so bad that i wanted to do myself bodily harm while watching them the fact that there is scene in which a shrunken head flies under a girls shirt so he can feel her up and she likes it is reason enough for everyone associated with this film to perish the link to west side story can only be a mockery since to reference such a great movie in such a horrible one is grounds alone to destroy all copies of this movie to make a long story short this film is horrible in every way and if i had my way everyone who likes it should go straight to hell
