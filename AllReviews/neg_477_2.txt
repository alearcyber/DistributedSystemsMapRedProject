NEG my brain was screaming why do you keep watching turn it off and go to bed but couch potatoness won out and i watched until the predictable ending i guess when its bruce campbell i need to give it a chancebr br i find it hard to complain about a low budget movie purely because of the low budget time and time again we see low budget movies proving that a good story good writing and good acting are enough to make a good movie ted and bruce got their start on just such a movie but they didnt seem to learn from sam that it takes a bit more than slapping it on film to make a moviebr br its sad too because bruce has always been a favorite after the s and s i just cant believe movies this bad are still being made bruce im really disappointed
