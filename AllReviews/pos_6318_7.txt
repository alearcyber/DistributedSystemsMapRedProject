POS one of the most significant quotes from the entire film is pronounced halfway through by the protagonist the mafia middleman titta di girolamo a physically nondescript middleaged man originally from salerno in southern italy when were introduced to him at the start of the film hes been living a nonlife in an elegant but sterile hotel in the italianspeaking canton of switzerland for the last ten years conducting a business we are only gradually introduced to while this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene takes place employees of the the swiss bank who normally count di girolamos cash tell him that  dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknotes at the news he quietly but icily threatens his coaxing bank manager of wanting to close down his account meanwhile he tells us the spectators that when you bluff you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous he says you cant bluff for a while and then halfway through tell the truth having eventually done this  bluffed only halfway through and told the truth and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately love  is exactly the reason behind the beginning of titta di girolamos troubles br br this initially unsympathetic character a scowling taciturn curt man on the verge of  a man who wont even reply in kind to chambermaids and waitresses who say hello and goodbye becomes at one point someone the spectator cares deeply about at one point in his nonlife titta decides to feel concern about appearing ridiculous the first half of the film may be described as slow by some it does indeed reveal di girolamos days and nights in that hotel at an oddly disjoined deliberate pace revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details however scenes that may have seemed unnecessary reveal just how essential they are as this masterfully constructed and innovative film unfolds before your eyes the existence of titta di girolamo  the man with no imagination identity or life the unsympathetic character you unexpectedly end up loving and feeling for when you least thought you would  is also conveyed with elegantly edited sequences and very interesting use of music one theme by the scottish band boards of canada especially stood out br br never was the contrast between the way hollywood and italy treat mobsters more at odds than since the release of films such as le conseguenze dellamore or limbalsamatore another interesting element was the way in which the film made use of the protagonists insomnia not unlike the machinist and in a far more explicit way the al pacino film insomnia le conseguenze dellamore uses this condition to symbolise a deeper emotional malaise thats been rammed so deep into the obscurity of the unconscious its almost impossible to pinpoint its cause if indeed there is one br br the young and sympathetic hotel waitress sofia played by olivia magnani granddaughter of the legendary anna and the memory of tittas best friend a man whom he hasnt seen in  years unexpectedly provide a tiny window onto life that titta eventually though tentatively at first accepts to look through again though its never explicitly spelt out the spectator knows that to a man like titta accepting the consequences of love will have unimaginable consequences a film without a single scene of sex or violence a film that unfolds in its own time and concedes nothing to the spectators expectations le conseguenze dellamore is a fine representative of that small quiet discreet renaissance that has been taking place in italian cinema since the decline of cinecitt during the second half of the s the world is waiting for italy to produce more il postinolike fare more la vita  bellastyle films neglecting to explore fine creations like le conseguenze dellamore limbalsamatore and others your loss world
