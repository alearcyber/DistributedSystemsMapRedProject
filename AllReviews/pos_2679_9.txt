POS i have just started watching this show its airing in ireland at the moment on the irish television station rte at pm in the afternoon as of th july br br this program literally makes me laugh out aloud and i cannot boast that on most sitcoms apart from uks the office with ricky gervais in itbr br todays episode of tkoq  july was the one where carrie starts a new job and invites her friends home and goes off to make some coffee and doug wants carrie to have no outside friends so he lifts up his top and shows off his belly hair and licks plates when he goes out to dinner but another funny episode was the other week when the old fella carries dad won on the bingo and that episode creased me up with laughter especially when they went out and got a replacement fridge and carries father stood there looking at it and thought it was newbr br so i dont know how much longer this has got to run on irish tv or at which stage year recorded we are at but i hope it dont end soon because i am really enjoying itbr br to sum up there is some great writing some great characters and comedy acting namely by carrie doug and carries father some great punchlines and delivered well  a bit saucy and near the mark sometimes send the kids out the room but i think this us sitcom is a winner and very funny
