NEG put this movie out of its misery and burn the negatives what am i saying the whole movie was negative fortunately only a very few would find this movie the least bit appealing this is what the vast american majority would call too much sex and violence it will probably show up on some nonpremium cable channel someday just for the shock value but after editing out the nudity most of the violence will stay all that will be left is  minutes of really bad acting interspersed with  minutes of commercials there are just too many starving actors in hollywood
