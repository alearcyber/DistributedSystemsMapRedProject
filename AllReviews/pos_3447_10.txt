POS ive seen a few of mr boormans movies and didnt like much of them not that they are bad movies quite the contrary are good movies but not content i personally found entertaining however i think where the heart is although made to cater to the less than art savvy american audience is masterful as satire and as social commentary of the times it was made in ive had to replace this movie in my collection at least a half a dozen times since every time i loan it out to someone i know could appreciate its artistry on all its levels my copy fails to come back home to me lol the last time took  years to replace it since it was out of print for vhs sales has never been made as a dvd that i know of and had to wait till one of the premium cable channels ran it before i could tape it againbr br my favorite aspect after the nailonthehead social commentary is the paintings by timna woollard ive searched for  years to find anyone or anywhere that could lead me to where her work is available for sale or better yet a copy of the paintings in the movie without the ending credits rolling over them i have a room in my house that i dedicated to putting copies of her paintings in and no one seems to know if it ever was released as a coffee table book or video aquarium or as a documentary of her work if anyone does know of where i can acquire any sort of copy of timnas work or where her studio is in england please do not hesitate to contact me via email
