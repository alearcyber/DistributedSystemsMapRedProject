NEG recently i borrowed a copy of this mess of a movie which took me three sessions over three days to get through thats another comment in the makingbr br but what i wanted to comment on first was the carelessness on the special features of the dvd it included a game of memory which asks the playerviewer to match up pairs of animals in order for them to board the ark however every time it reveals the chosen animal the screen prompts the player to find or congratulates the player on findingits mate this is a spelling error since it should be its mate as possessive pronoun not a contraction for it is it is an annoying error to keep repeating  or more times to finish a game of course its a kids activity really but teaches kids incorrect spellingbr br and oh yeah the game never changes it is the same game with the same locations of the same animals each time plus it doesnt keep score like the number of moves it took to solve the game so there is no lasting value or challenge to it its just a feature to list on the packagingbr br simply put there could have been more thought and care put into this special feature just like there could have been more thought and care put into this muddled film
