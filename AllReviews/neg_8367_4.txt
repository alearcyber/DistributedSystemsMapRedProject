NEG at least if youre a disney fanatic well of the variety who loves their liveaction films as well as the animated stuff if youre a kid if youre a kid at heart almost to the extent that you hardly realize youre an adult if you love absolutely any film that features animals especially when theyre doing tricks or if youre just not too demanding air bud world pup is somewhat enjoyable to watch im a disney fanatic i enjoyed this film enough and ill gladly watch it againbr br but boy does it have a lot of problems the main flaw arises from a combination of too many characters too many plot threads and not enough time to take care of them all in the space of  minutes weve got adults getting married teens falling in love and trying not to be awkward at it teen competition for love and jealousy preteens playing spy games dogs falling in love dogs playing soccer dogs having puppies manipulative parents wholl do anything to make their kids win being taught a lesson by their kids housekeeper dilemmas and crooks cooking up and executing elaborate plots im probably forgetting something but thats  big plot issues to be dealt with with less than  minutes per thread to deal with them and presumably weave them into a coherent whole thats both not too complicatedthis is a kids film after alland thats also humorous and heartwarming not surprisingly director bill bannerman on his first turn being completely in charge he has a lot of previous second unit experience wasnt quite up to the task im sure it didnt help that there were at least three screenwriters involved and probably dictating producers as wellbr br the end result is that air bud world pup is extremely choppy events occur with little justification and worse often little explanation people figure out and do things primarily because they need toand fastso that everything can arrive where it needs to arrive in less than  minutes from one cut to the next time might jump ahead six months or so we have both adults who seem like maybe theyre mentally disabled and kids who just intuitively figure out what a dog is thinking and rush into some unexpected action some of the threads should have simply been removed because its difficult to become too engaged in the film when as soon as youre introduced to an idea its already passed you bybr br also not helping is the fact that one of the threads is basically a ripoff of one hundred and one dalmatians  minus a cruella de vil character and another problem is that given the way the film is edited i have to assume that the dog air bud probably couldnt do much with the soccer ball unlike the first two films a dog playing a sport is almost an afterthought here and when we see him its in very quick glimpses every once in a while these snippets appear to be even aided by computer animationbr br yet for someone like me theres a cheesy charm to air bud world pup the script and performances often teeter between ridiculous hokey and kinda clichd i tend to like that combination it makes the film both a bit predictable and subtly bizarre and at times like the ending when the film completely abandons consistency and basically becomes a commercial for the us womens soccer team air bud world pup is so blatantly tacky that you cant help but love it
