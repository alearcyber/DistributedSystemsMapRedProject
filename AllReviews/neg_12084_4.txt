NEG not good mostly because you dont give a damn about what happens to all these people some comments   i am tired of seeing governesses who never talk to their pupils never teach them anything and take a tired and annoyed look whenever the said pupil who of course has been won over in the space of  seconds says something  fine so rosina has a father complex and therefore is attracted to her employer but charles is completely different in all aspects from her father  if anything henry is much closer as a sensual exalted person  how could you ever believe that she would be more attracted to tom wilkinson than to rhys meyer  hard to believe if she had been in fact raised as a deeply religious girl that she would be so careless about sleeping with a gentile after knowing him for  minutesbr br some good things about the film  at least she didnt end up pregnant not knowing who the father was the whole description of life in the jewish community in london is good
