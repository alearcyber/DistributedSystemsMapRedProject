POS i first saw this movie when i was very little i was born in  so it was around the age when s cartoons were big my mother taped it one day thinking i might like it i had never even heard of the rainbow bright tv show before i was introduced to the movie when i saw it on one of those old beta tapes i loved it i became addicted to it there are people who say its badly written and all that but its a kids movie and things like that dont matter much to children i loved the story and especially liked the songs and all the female characters of course i pretended to be them and in the scene where rainbow first met krys and they were repulsed they had to work with the opposite sex i could totally relate the story was the basic good vs evil that children enjoy and there were enough happy moments to balance out the scary ones the world is a fantastic place that would stimulate the imagination of any young child i am very glad i had an opportunity to see this movie when i was little it made a big impact and watching it now brings back happy memories of childhood i would recommend to any parent with young children to rent this movie it will trigger their imagination and provide plenty of entertainment youre only a child once so dont let them miss out on this one
