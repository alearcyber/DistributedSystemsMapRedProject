NEG i just watched this yesterday and wanted to read other peoples scathing comments but found some high marksbr br what this was probably the worst asian horror movie ive seenbr br spoilers there were just so many fundamental problems with the story a lot of asian horror has the twist of spirits trying to help but just looking scary with notable exceptions ringu and juon this is the case here except they arent scary a pretty asian woman who looks a little pale isnt scary at all the monk character straight up explains everything as being a perfectly natural cycle of life nothing scary there either but the woman just doesnt get it she would rather kill herself and her baby then let this poor ghost be reincarnated my friend and i were just laughing when she jumped off the building twice and the ghost waits until after the second time to tell her why shes been following her around that information would have been nice to know before she started jumping but whateverbr br that said i did like a couple of parts right in the middle first she rides a taxi with a ghost ghosts ride taxis that has a whole lot of extra hair which inexplicably is creepy right after that at the bus stop well you need to see it as its pretty messed upbr br all in all this movie is a total bomb i gave it an extra point just for those two scenes above this is a poor quality asian horror that manages to make ghosts flying into womens wombs almost beautiful while trying to scare you with the same images
