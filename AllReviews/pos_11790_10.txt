POS i thought this film was excellent quirky and different to the usual run of the mill disengaged cop catching serial killer film kiefer sutherland was brilliant as usual  i really dont think i have seen anything that he has done where he has not acted brilliantly the dialogue was funny at times lightening the mood and the plot engaging thanks to other reviewers for showing the link with alice in wonderland  i hadnt picked up on those i would recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of kiefer sutherlands as i am and to anyone who wants to watch an entertaining film for a couple of hours it was a shame that it wasnt released at the cinemas for a wider audience
