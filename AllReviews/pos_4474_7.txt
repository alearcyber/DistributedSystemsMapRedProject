POS the story starts out with a soldier being transported to a desert town then goes back in time to tell the tale of how he came to this place he started out as an officer in napoleons army fighting in egypt but became separated from his unit after nearly starving andor dying of thirst he came upon a leopard which somehow became his bosom buddy it brought him food and before long the soldier became almost totally wild so acute was his bonding with the animal all things do end however and the man decided it was necessary for him to leave the critter a very strange film well written and portrayed beautiful scenery from jordan and utah which didnt always blend perfectly but who cares
