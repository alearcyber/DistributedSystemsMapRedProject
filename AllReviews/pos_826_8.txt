POS like steven seagal i also am a big van damme fan and have followed most of his movies since the start of his acting careerbr br in this flick van damme assumes the role of jack robideaux whom is a cop that just moved to new mexico from new orleans to work as part of the border patrol haunted by memories of his past it is up to jack to put an end to a group of exnavy seals from smuggling illegal drugs into the us that killed his daughterbr br overall i found this film to be very good van damme is in very good shape for  years old and can really move the action scenes are very intense and the movie even throws a couple of plot twists in to keep you guessing unfortunately van damme does not have the same intensity as he did say  years ago regardless the shepherd border control is the rd straight solid film that van damme has made possibly opening the door for a larger projectbr br i definitely recommend this movie to a van damme fan or fan of action movies in general the shepherd border control is a great movie not as good as until death but better than the hard corps be sure to give this one a try you will not be disappointed
