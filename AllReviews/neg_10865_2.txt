NEG okay so writerdirector larry bishop obviously has some important connections and knows the right people in hollywood in order to produce his own film and fill up the cast with eyecatching names good for him now what he really still needs is inspiration and talent in order to come up with an actually worthwhile scenario rather than the overly pretentious and wannabe convoluted crap he penned down here hell ride isnt a movie its a hectic and hopelessly inept fanboy endeavor to bring homage to the notorious bikerflicks of the s and to the recently revived grindhouse cinema formula in general with hell ride larry bishop embarrassingly fails in his setup and there are many obvious reasons for this he hasnt got a story to tell  or at least not a very interesting one  but gravely tries to cover this up through numerous redundant plot twists loads of gratuitous and very womenunfriendly sleaze overlong and piteous dialogs aspiring to be cool and giant amounts of senseless violence the plot looks complex but can actually be summarized in one sentence the ancient vendetta between two rivaling biker gangs flares up again with the arrival of a new member a boy who may or not be the long lost son of a doublecrossing wench that got executed back in  thats it seriously all the rest going from betraying gang members over to the recruitment of old timer members over to toying with his nymphomaniac informant girl is all completely pointless and confusing padding material another major problem in hell ride is larry bishops very own tremendous and seemingly insatiable ego he definitely shouldnt have rewarded himself with the role of tough and relentless gang leader as that only comes across as incredibly pretentious and narrowminded especially when there are so many other and more experienced stars in the movie granted bishop starred in a couple of genuine s biker exploitation movies like the savage seven and angel unchained but that was a long time ago and he honestly isnt any good as an actor maybe it simply was bishops lifelong dream to play a character that always outsmarts his enemies and for which every hot babe sexually craves and just wrote a whole screenplay around it the veterans in the cast like dennis hopper and michael madsen dont really bother to leave a plausible impression and i cant say i blame them this whole production is lame and pathetic and i cant bring myself to recommending it to anyone regardless of many beautiful babes parade around with bare breasts and naked butts
