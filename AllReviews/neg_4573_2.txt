NEG i love oddball animation i love a lot of asian films but i didnt love this particular product of japan the fuccons are supposedly an american family theyre all mannequins who have moved to japan and theyre somewhat a s sitcom type family with slightly more modern sensibilities at times the dvd features several very short episodes like less than  minutes each and i did not find it to be either funny or entertaining not even in a weird way im not sure what the appeal is of this i did pick up on some satire here and there gosh who wouldnt but satire is usually somewhat humorous isnt it and nothing i saw or heard rated even a little smirk i picked this up used and it certainly sounded appealing but i guess either im missing the point or its just plain lame the box even says its fuccon hilarious right there on the front but i beg to differ  out of
