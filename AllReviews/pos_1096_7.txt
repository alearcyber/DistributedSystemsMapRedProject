POS i enjoyed very much the movie wooden camera i think its a little bit influenced by the brazilian movie city of god but maybe this parallelism between the two tracks possible to follow crime and art in social neighborhood are a reality br br i think the films made by madiba are really beautiful i dont think its unreal that he shoot such good films because theres a lot of artists that dont have any type of education and can be really genius br br i enjoyed very much the soundtrack its adjusted to the picturesbr br see the movieits good to show how can be a life in a social neighborhood
