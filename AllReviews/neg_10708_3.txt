NEG this movie is awful beyond belief its a lowbudget badly written piece of pointless garbage but the saturday afternoon i stumbled across it on tv still sticks in my mind as one of the most entertaining ive ever spent in front of the television the badness of this movie is epic  maybe not ed wood epic but close the premise is hysterical men are banned for being too dangerous and imprisoned in  haw  football stadiums the pseudodyke culture is laughably bizarre theres an underground sex trade with women who dress up like men to service deviants and the last man of the title is a pitiful reincarnation of rocky from rocky horror picture show i didnt get to see the end of it which i have to assume was so dripping with syrupy what have we all learned from this nonsense it would bring on an urge to brush the teeth but everything in the first twothirds was so memorably bad even if the last third turned out to be a pale imitation of the rest its still worthwhile for anyone who gets a kick out of campy stupid brainless scifi bflicks
