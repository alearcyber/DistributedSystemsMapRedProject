POS on first viewing this movie seems to be some kind of fairy tale about a beautiful and significantly white horse once seen never forgotten however viewed strictly within the context of the story the implication is that to survive in the immediate postcivil war america one had to have a horse and not any old horse but a truly great one and eagles wing is such a horse but for a man to be worthy of such a horse is another matter who should own it the native american or the awol soldier the story throughout pits primitivism against civilisation as has been said by other commentators it is ironic that it took an english director to perceive this fact and then develop this simple theme into a western like no other youre ever likely to see again the film is basically about this beast and the savage harshness of the environment and the people who scrape a living from it the photography and the soundtrack are exquisite martin sheens performance is a revelation this film released in the same year as sheens other great performance as willard in apocalypse now hints at his abilities which somehow were never given such a free rein again mores the pity a comparison of the two stories throws up the surprising similarities between them  not least that both films chart a mans journey into his soul in order to find redemption whereas willard is redeemed i will leave it to the viewer to decide if pike is eventually the ending is fabulous in the true sense of the word and very moving be warned altogether this is an extraordinary film
