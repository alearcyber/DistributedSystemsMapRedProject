NEG the tv ads for this movie showed the warlocks hitting a truck headon then getting smashed to bits and reforming on the other side of the truck i thought the special effects were good but the general style of the movie was wimpy this is the charmed tv series with three boys instead of three girlsbr br the big surprise for the three teens who are about to become adults is that there is an unknown fourth member of the clan who is out to get them and consolidate all their power besides driving into trucks these kids can fly up the sides of houses climb out of windows push each other into stacks of garbage and make the veins in their necks pop out but if they use their powers too often they become prematurely old and feeble the father of one of the boys is evidence of this as he sits in an attic made up to look like a mummy but he is only  years oldbr br the three good warlocks are each filthy rich in his own right completely spoiled obnoxious and annoying in any public school these kids would be beaten up every day their glares and facial ticks would not cut any mustard with the boys from the hood unfortunately for all good people these charmed boys were sent to hogwarts reform school for the warlocks that couldnt get into harry potters classbr br so what was the movie all about three teenagers acting out with each other and their girlfriends one other teenager who envies their power and money and happens to be a lost relative after a few scenes where the charmed boys show off their powers and have sex with their girlfriends the movie gets around to the unknown warlock teens revenge plot the predictable stuff happens the bad warlock ambushes various friends of the other warlocks and eventually starts attacking them too the final confrontation happens and that is about itbr br the special effects are not bad but nothing special if you like to see fireballs spiders and blue veins then this is a good movie to watch
