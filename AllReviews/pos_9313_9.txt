POS how is bears paw elephants trunk or monkeys brain for dinner let tsui hark tell you in this wonderful and lighthearted comedy about the art of cooking the traditional chinese waybr br this movie shares the common structure of an american sports movie but instead of focusing on baseball it centers around cooking which makes it all the more interesting i even think leslie cheungs character look a lot like charlie sheen in major leaguebr br this movie also contains a bit of zhao wen zhao vs xiong xin xin fighting love seeing more of that after the blade and a quite funny injoke concerning a leon lai pop songbr br perhaps not the ideal movie for the strict vegetarian though
