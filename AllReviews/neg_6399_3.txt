NEG i just finished watching this movie and largely found it a waste of time with little or no redeeming factors i really dont understand where all the positive reviews came from  the animation is clunky and unrefined the plot makes no sense at all from an objective standpoint and there is no sense of intrigue or suspense in that which is trying to pass itself off as an intriguing and suspenseful film i have never read the book so i cant say if the movie was faithful but as with most movie adaptations it tries too hard to cram as much information into the shortest amount of time possible the result is a disjointed and illogical storyline that doesnt really let you understand or relate to the characters or actually anything at all overall i felt completely detached from the characters and the plot to the point where i couldnt bring myself to care about what happened to them and the only way i can see how this animation could be considered beautiful is if your normal standard of animation is a scoobydoo cartoon
