NEG i saw this on sci fi and in retrospect im not sure how i actually managed to watch it all the way through this is utter trash its not a b movie its a d movie at bestbr br basically this grim reaper looking thing on a horse and sometimes not on one goes killing everything in its path somewhere in the mid west of america a load of people are missing infact murdered and a bunch of mismatched spec op soldier types go looking for them the best part of this movie ill tell it now is theres some really cute girls let me now spoil this by telling you that all but the least cute one get their heads either chopped off slashed apart or hit so hard with a mle weapon that the head explodes off thats no spoiler the gore in this movie is over the top and really grotesque it serves no real purpose eitherbr br heres whats good the sets look ok the actors sometimes act ok the outfits and props some of them are decentbr br everything else that you can think of sucks a lot of the badness is in the editing some times it just switches over from a rapid action scene to a real quiet and dormant scene sometimes the characters do nonunderstandable things and theyre always splitting up but not even in a way that the viewer can follow looks like they get split up without realizing it amongst themselves but they also all seem to know that theyre splitting up all the time and are ok with it even tho theyre in a really dangerous situation and theres bodies all over the place and people are dying right and left nothing in this movie is the least bit plausible most of it is incoherent and confusing and i dont really get how this immortal indestructible bad guy killer was able to be stopped in the end and frankly i dont care too much stupid hilariously bad nonsense happens during this movie and i dont really care to list it all here and theyre all so serious throughout the whole ordeal when its almost laughably bad just awfulbr br this movie is a complete waste of time theres no excuse for watching this unless the only channel you happen to receive is scifi and youre bound to a chair in front of the tv but if youre not bound youre better off doing a crossword throwing a frisbee or even just thinking theres lots of much better b movies that you can watchbr br my senior year in high school my friend and i in visual communication and deign class made a long movie trailer type deal for our own movie there was no full movie just a really long trailer and we did a better job of filming and editing the piece with premiere it was better work than this movie that really says something about this and im puzzled and troubled as to why sci fi would show anything like this when there are so many good low rate movies they can showbr br the only movie that ive ever endured that was worse than this is raptor island another brilliant scifi workthough it had smoother and more followable flow than this movie but this comes very close and is definitely nd on my list of worst movies ive ever seen
