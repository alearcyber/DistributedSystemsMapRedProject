NEG if you are a pretentious person it would sound like a good idea to brag about your intellectuality saying that you really like this moviebr br otherwise dont bother and better watch something goodbr br this is the stereotypical movie for snobs the plot line would be very silly if you could see it from beginning to end it is just presented in a messed up way as an attempt to make it hard to understand and make the movie look intellectualbr br mullholland drive is not enjoyable to watch you would very rarely understand anything the first time you see it and if you do you would most likely be disappointed because it is not a big deal
