NEG the title is from a passage in the bible deut  lets just say it is taken horribly out of context  but nonetheless that is where the title of this agonizing movie originates the other reviewers cover the plot details so i wont rehash but the husband who is a psychiatrist delivers a lecture on inferior function where he discusses how a person can meet another another person and they can experience a cataclysmic crisis in their lives where they cease to be masters of themselves and incapable of fair judgement he is saying this at the podium at the exact moment as he lays eyes on leonora vail in the audience  the woman who will become his mistress not very subtle for showing that this is indeed what will happen to this poor manbr br i think the whole premise of the movie is implausible and just didnt work here is an overthehill psychiatrist and we are to believe this young beautiful woman falls for him and comes between the happiness he and his wife shared whats even more implausible is how the betrayed wife responds when she learns of the infidelity not only is she understanding but she insists her husband embark on a several month vacation with the tramp  so we all can get a little relief from this unbearable stress give me a break i wanted to reach through the screen and throttle not just the adulterer but the dimwit wifebr br the fact that the whole movie takes place as a flashback after already revealing the end of the movie at the beginning the fact that the husband had a terrible accident  it leaves no doubt as to the outcome of the sordid affair i think this was a poor decision as it leaves absolutely no plot twists to look forward to as the whole movie is completely predictable you already know the wifes resignation to the affair at the beginning of the film as she summons the mistress to the dying mans bedside and expresses no ill will towards herbr br not only is the script defective but noel coward is horribly miscast even though it is his screenplay he and leonora have absolutely no chemistry on screen whatsoever its interesting that michael redgrave was originally cast in that role but was replaced during filming i wonder what that was about in the end neither the husband or the wife cause you to feel any sympathy for either one of them i do think margaret leighton played the part of strumpet quite well but she couldnt possibly overcome all the negatives this film had also as is the case of many british productions of this era the dialogue is hard to understand due to the clipped fast speech pattern of the actors i saw it on tv and couldnt even rely on closed captioning to fill in the blanks for mebr br dont waste your time on this one
