NEG abderrahmane sissako may have known what he was doing when he made bamako but the rest of us can just sit back in mystification and confusion trying to figure out what that purpose might have beenbr br the nominal plot involves a young african singer whos planning on leaving her unemployed husband to find work in the city but far more of the screen time is taken up with what the publicists for the film describe as a mock trial against key financial institutions dealing with the overwhelming economic hardships of africa thats all well and good i suppose but when the arguments and ideas are put forth in as undramatic and pedantic a way as they are here they lose both force and impact put another way if the director had found the means to actually incorporate issues such as the injurious effect of colonialism on the african people and the problem of african debt into anything even remotely resembling a compelling storyline the film might have achieved the intellectual and emotional resonance it now so clearly lacksbr br the topics the movie is dealing with may be relevant and important but trying to pass off what amounts to two hours worth of speechifying as an actual honesttogod movie is not likely to garner much of an audience for ones message
