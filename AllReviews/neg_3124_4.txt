NEG spoilersbr br oh sure its based on moby dick totally obsessed and it destroys him its a total folly the movie starts off rather well but by the end of the film everyone else is destroyed and the main stars mind is a blankbr br the supposed half sister is never convincing some very poor lighting effects music is interesting but little else it took me over a month to finally finish the darn thing i suppose if you like being john malkovich you might like this but where as bjm was a great movie that i just didnt want to watch again pola x is a movie i just hate to high hell the only possible excitement in the film is the gratuatious incest sexual scene towards the end of the film hopefully yer not thinking of catherine eitherbr br this movie is severely boring depressing and poorly directed not highly recommended if if you like french movies go watch crimson rivers insteadbr br br br quality  entertainment  replayable
