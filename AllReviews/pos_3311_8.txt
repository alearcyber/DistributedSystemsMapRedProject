POS thats a bad raunchy predictable tacky salacious soap opera the best of everything is just such a guilty pleasure for me something along the lines of valley of the dolls i mean best has everything somebody gets pregnant out of wedlock whens the last time you heard that phrase there are affairs everywhere drinking backstabbing jealousy and even a tragic but not altogether unexpected deathbr br caroline bender hope lange and mike rice the delicious stephen boyd are the centerpieces of the goingson their chemistry is immediate and is the glue that keeps this film from becoming too fragmentedbr br suzy parker the offthechart gorgeous exfashion model appears as gregg adams an aspiring stage actress a role that according to any biography ive ever read about her was apparently not much of a stretch but parker does a surprisingly credible job here more than holding her own in a couple of scenes opposite louis jourdan who plays david savage jourdan probably took this role for the money and the special screen credit because he was clearly headed down the aging starhasbeen roadbr br diane baker is fine as naive gullible april morrison martha hyer as barbara lemont has a particularly juicy storyline and film legend joan crawford chews her usual serving of scenery as amanda farrow another role like jourdans savage that crawford likely took for the paycheckbr br there is some obviously dated dialog and plot devices this is  and the predictability of the soap opera genre but if you like a good soap as i do the best of everything will more than satisfy you
