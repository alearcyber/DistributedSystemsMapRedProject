POS this is a remake of the anime classic from the s and this one is even better sylia nene linna and priss are all back as the knight sabers in their hardsuits battling the robotic boomers the animation is crisp the characters are welldeveloped and the action rocks priss is a singer in her regular job so the series features some wonderful songs as well there is a fair amount of violence but most of it is against robots and there is some fan service but nothing too racy the dvds also have many extras including commentaries which really enhance your understanding and enjoyment of the show a musthave for any anime fanbr br also recommended burst angel armitage iii
