POS i have copied my video of this on to dvd so that i can enjoy it whenever i like and it makes a very successful and rare wedding present as well this is just an absolutely wonderful adaptation of a much loved novel everything about it is just perfect and it has aged amazingly well there is always a chance with something this old that it might appear a bit creaky next to more modern dramas but precious bane more than holds its ownbr br the quality of the acting is amazing with janet mcteer making a superlative prudence and a young clive owen stomping around as the taciturn gideon sarn br br i challenge anyone to watch the final sequence without at least sniffling a little at the sheer romance of it all it is the perfect film to watch when it is cold outside and you are snuggled up on the sofabr br i really cant recommend this highly enough
