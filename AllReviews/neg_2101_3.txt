NEG upon renting this i wasnt expecting to be blown away in fact i knew it was going to be horrible it was just seeing how horrible it really was thats what comes with low budget horrorbr br snakes on a train not to be confused with the serpentine summer blockbuster snakes on a plane with samuel l jackson is about a woman who is put under a mayan curse that causes snakes to hatch inside her and devour her from within her only hope of surviving lies in a shaman that lives across the border so she and her companion stowaway onto a train bound for los angelas throw in a few passengers and hilarity ensuesbr br come to think of it though the story isnt half bad isnt half good eitherbr br the acting in this film rivals that of a scifi original if not worse trust me its horrible the snakes were another problem they were supposed to be rattlers i guess but most of what you get instead are mostly harmless garden snakes that dont attack anything and theres this rattling sound effect that gets really annoyingbr br the gore effects on the other hand while not on the tom savini level were actually pretty goodbr br and another thing the ending alone makes up for the rest of the movie im not going to talk about it here so youll have to rent this and see for yourself
