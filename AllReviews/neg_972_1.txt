NEG there comes a time in every big name actors career when they get sloppy and accept projects that they wouldnt have touched with a  ft pole in their golden days remember taxi driver that was a fine film i can hardly believe that the de niro of showtime is the same actorbr br i would rather watch time chasers twice than see this film again if anyone offers to take you to see showtime or gives you free passes or whatever run away as fast and far as you can
