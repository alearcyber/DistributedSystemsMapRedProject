NEG this movie has the distinction of being the worst movie i have ever seen and the only film i have ever given a  out of  on imdb as of yet i was fooled into renting it because of the cool hr giger cover art on the box this cover art is the only thing the least bit good about this steaming pile ofbr br it was about frat boys fighting freaks in a strange but not the least bit interesting post apocalyptic world where the cities are in ruinschaos but apparently the suburbs are still a safe and wonderful place for young men to haze other men into braindead frat organizations the most uninspiring performances by boring characters not so special effects dreary unoriginal scenery and just generally extremely poor quality in all production aspects make this lemon the all time loser on my listbr br final rating  i wish i could give it a zerobr br noob aalox
