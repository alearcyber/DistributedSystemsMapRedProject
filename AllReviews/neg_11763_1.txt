NEG  years after this was made castro still reigns unfortunately were left scratching our heads wondering how the dimwitted maniac played by scenerychewing jack palance made it as far as  i stumbled back across this recently and was amused at noticing the incomparable sid haig and b movie favorite paul untouchables picerni among the rebels fleischer was obviously well past his prime when he directed this foolishness some of the lines are classic in a did he really say that kind of way the other thing i just noticed is that the score and the sound not the dialog are actually excellent  the only firstrate elements of the entire production so dont watch this to learn anything about history or acting but if you feel like watching this as a goof bring the beers and have some fun
