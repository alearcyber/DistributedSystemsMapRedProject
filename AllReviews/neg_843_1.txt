NEG this is supposed to be based on wilkie collins thewomaninwhite but the only resemblance it bore to that story were the characters names the time period and the settings if they were going to change the story so thoroughly i dont understand why they needed to keep up the pretense that it came from wilkie collins go read the book its much better
