NEG for native mongolian speakers the film lacked emotion and emphasis used too many non native speakers especially jamukha too many diversions from the actual history terrible terrible subtitle i wonder where and who did that subtitle it was both in english and thai i wonder how bad the subtitle was in thai if the english subtitle was soooo bad described the one of the greatest leaders life very uninteresting there are better films made by mongolian directors with very low budget from s honestly im wondering if the film critics of academy award is that lenient or what only good thing was some good cgi in some fighting scenes only moderately not over the top cgi
