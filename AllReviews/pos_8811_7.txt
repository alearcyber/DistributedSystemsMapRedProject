POS cardiff wales a bunch of  mates are deeply bored in this town theres jip who works in a clothes shop coop an easygoing dj nina inseparable from her best friend lulu and moff the week is hell for them and they only wait for one thing the weekend at this time they got out to a nightclub and to the sound of tech no music they experience different drugs particularly ecstasy then they usually continue the party to a friends at the end of this really good time on sunday the feelings are the following ones tiredness melancholy just the memory of a crazy nightbr br surfing on the wave of the notorious success of trainspotting  this debut movie written and directed by justin kerrigan brings and develops a new variation about the notion of hedonism it means how to have fun as much as possible while knowing that you have a shortened lapse of time indeed as i have previously written for the  main characters of the movie the week is hell and the weekend is the only time they can free themselves and have a wild time without the single pressure besides jip in one sequence talks about the positive aspects of shooting oneself you are numb you dont feel any pressure you are like an astronaut in orbit above the earth kerrigans relentless directorial style expresses very well the spirit of debauchery and care freeness of the  protagonists they only live to take advantage as much as possible of an hedonist weekend furthermore to spice up a little more the festive atmosphere in which his movie bathes kerrigan isnt afraid to include dreamlike sequences which represent his characters fantasy or embarrassments then human traffic  is also served by a particularly bouncy sound track the amount a perfect symbiosis between the sound and the music at last this weekend of euphoria enables to shelve momentarily the usual drab image of the popular social classes british cinema has studied a lotbr br notwithstanding when a movie conscientiously or not exploits the fame of another famous one it rarely matches the brilliance of its predecessor human traffic is in this condition theres little inventiveness at the level of the narrative structure and the introduction of the characters and one can note down a few useless digressions jip who in the nightclub goes in the managers office and tells him a cockandbull story so as to enable moff to enter the club but thats no use because the latter succeeds in coming without problems one can also blame kerrigan to overlook the dramatic sides that the story could have involved his movie can also be read as a transition from euphoria to paranoia and the dramatic connotations of this second pole arent virtually explored its a shame it could have conveyed the following message even in the happiest moments there can be something terrible preparing which can flop them the same remark could also be said when coop has a fit of jealousy because nina broaches a guybr br it may not be the last great film of the nineties as it is billed on the dvd cover but human traffic is to be taken as a good and incisive little movie which conveys with the styles and the fashions of the end of the twentieth century a will to have fun without ulterior motives and trouble an ideal movie to start any party or before going to a club
