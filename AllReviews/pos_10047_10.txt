POS i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was it tells the story of custer played by errol flynn during and after his graduation from westpoint although ive heard that the film isnt very historically accurate hollywood never is i still enjoyed it as i knew little of the real events anywaybr br i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic it brought me close to tears as he and ned sharp arthur kennedy rode to their deaths on little big hornbr br i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually wasbr br ill give this film  out of
