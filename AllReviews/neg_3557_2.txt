NEG i watched this movie based on the good reviews here and i wont make that mistake againbr br the first couple minutes shows that a group of people have been brought together by some tragedy but you dont see what it is flashback hours and we get to see the boring lives of each of these people which in the end are totally meaningless to what is about to happen when the ending is finally reveled you realize that you just wasted an hour of your life waiting for a big payoff that doesnt happen and means nothing to what you have been watching the only connection these people have is that they have all had a bad daybut even that continuity gets lost in the boredombr br if this was supposed to be a crash clone its a complete failure
