NEG is this a game fmv or a movie in all honesty i watched this one out of choicelessness it is a very big waste of time and moneybr br it seems hk movies are heading in the opposite direction of the rest of the worldbr br try to put more effort and money into a production and make us want to watch rather than something you want us to watchbr br the graphics are so horrible than they looked like something out of the early to mids low resolution games in comparison to todaysbr br the way they made this movie is almost exactly what they did in the s wing commander game namely the third installment of the series stop regressing and make us asian look so bad at this compared to the big guns in hollywoodbr br sure they have big budgets and better actors but we have some of the oldest histories the myths and the legends the best technophiles and possibly the largest computer graphic talent base in the world so what went so very very wrong did you start using the same old companies that have been working with you for so many films please stop wasting our time and money this is the reason why hk movies are heading downhill so rapidly didnt you claim to be the hollywood of the orient guess not
