NEG staten island filmmaker andy milligan is well known in the horror community for being an even worse director than ed wood and with this as a dim example of his output im apt to agree with them in the ghastly ones we basically have three bickering couples traveling to their childhood home located on a conveniently secluded island to collect an inheritance there they are killed off one by one and the events unfold in murdermystery fashion with a scarred retard hunchback butler added to throw you for a loop the film is in such bad shape that it looks like someone just ran it through a dishwasher the sound is terrible the dialog is otherworldly bad theres some primitive mannequin gore plus some dismemberments and guts and its technically inept in every possible way it can be inept but is it enjoyable in a bad movie kind of way sort of its excruciating to watch but oddly entertaining in a train wreck fashion approach with caution if youre not a fan of horrible movies better deep six this one
