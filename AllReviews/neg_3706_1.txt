NEG the capture of bigfoot is one of the silliest and worst movies of all time i love sasquatch and bigfoot movies but this one is just a sheer waste of ones timeterrible terrible terriblei watched this movie last night and it was all i could do to finish watchingi understood that this weird crazy man wanted to capture bigfootbut that was the only thing that made sense in this movieit did have some amusing parts thoughthere was this very cheesy and corny disco club with very bad disco dancing that seemed to go on for far too long in the moviei think the director was trying to fill timethe worst thing was the way the bigfoot lookedthe obvious man in a suit looked like a pink faux fur bigfootit was laughableif you want to see a very bad bigfoot movie then i suggest that you purchase this moviepersonally i wasted my time and my money on this one
