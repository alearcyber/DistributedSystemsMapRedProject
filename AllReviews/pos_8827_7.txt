POS my main criticism is quite simply that it isnt long enough or detailed enough i would have loved to see more of everything the building of the vessel the engineering the training the first lift to orbit preparations for departure venus orbital injection everything i would have liked to see more of the first leg venus to earth instead of zipping there like a n corporation bus in fact i would have liked to see a series on the scale of earth story made of this with a full hour dedicated to every planet and maybe another to the loop around the sun as it was i was left hungry on the other hand i do understand budgets and viewers attentionspansbr br re the science lets be fair about the speedoflight timelag they did mention at the beginning that there was a lag in conversations but they let this evaporate once they reached the outer planets some kind of conversation had to be presented to the viewers and we have to assume that the lag was edited out for the sake of palatability so no complaints there but zero for noisy spaceships the only film in which spaceships make no noise was kubricks  and even then he copped out by using the noise of the crew breathing in their helmets  which was pretty effective i wish the makers of space odyssey had realized just how eerie the sight of vast rocketmotors blasting in absolute silence might be but alas pegasus lets out much the same roar as every other cardboard spaceship in every other cardboard scifi filmbr br but the rest of the science was excellent no complaints there in fact praise for bringing out the radiation problems as well as they did i just hope that having done this film wont discourage the bbc from making a really detailed version but i suppose thats not for next week or next year either
