NEG koyaanisquatsi is simply the best film ive ever seen its a masterpiece where everything is at the right place some scenes are not nice or beautiful but the camera never peeks or intrudes this is exactly whats happening here the camera is used to intrude to disgrace and to ridicule there is no magic flow here no sense of greatness or respect instead some scenes are cobbled together without greater purpose or plan the music is disturbing just as i rated koyaanisquatsi the best film ever made this one is the worst its a pure movie too but this is the negative form exactly that which should not be done
