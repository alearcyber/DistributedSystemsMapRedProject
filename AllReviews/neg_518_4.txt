NEG submerged is definitely not the worst movie ever it does have its flaws such as borrowed footage crazy script and nonexistent special effects these are the worst but it also has some good points too the acting is surprisingly good there are lots of familiar faces whom you probably know if ure a bmovie fan like mebr br i was very glad to see brent huff playing one of the heroes knowing him mostly for his s action films and i must admit he is not a bad actor at all fred williamson maxwell caulfield  tim thomerson get some limited screen time but are believable in their parts the eyecandies in this fred olen ray movie are yvette nipar and nicole eggert both looking very sexy and very mean michael bailey smith adds some muscle to the background as a navy seal unfortunately the only cast member who in my opinion is completely out of place is coolio he doesnt act at all talks like he didnt even read the script and being a badass in the beginning of the movie gets shot like a wimp a hour later not a good choicebr br to sum this movie up  this is not such a bad choice for late night entertainment if you can get over the special effects thing so many guns so much fire and not a single wound on anyone coolios annoying performance and the recycled footage from airport  you might like this nobrainer after all
