POS emilio is a successful business man a perfect father and a good husband or that is what everybody think the perfect storyline he has carefully built all along these years will start closing around him all of a sudden will he be able to keep up with his own liesbr br this is a very well laid out drama with great acting and steady direction even though the plot is pushed up to the limit to increase the tension the movie explores some of our worst fears do we really know the people we deal with can we be so surebr br the story develops at an increasingly faster pace as it reaches the point where emilio is not in control of his lies anymore a good deal of spanish movies have interesting stories but are far from technical proficiency the perfect rhythm and well shot scenes make the actors so credible we get inside emilio and hate him and suffer for him as his situation gets more and more desperate there is no need for any spanish folklore nor is this an attempt to create a hollywood style flick this is real spain  and regardless the obvious unlikeliness of emilios life existing in reality there are good chances somebody we know is not quite like the person he claims to be not just a great commercial product it will let you wondering where lies can get us to can we keep upbr br well done
