NEG this had the promise of being an interesting film the subject matter was certainly a promising one  the excesses of the catholic church during the counterreformation however not only was this not developed other than a two paragraph introduction many things were not explained  ie the gypsies the anabaptists the inquisitors and their relationship to the one true church nor were the politics of the time explained ie the relationship between the catholic church and its supporters like the holy roman emperor though these may have been apparent to an austrian audience the lack of explanation makes it confusing for americansbr br but perhaps its a good thing that they didnt emphasize the history since what they showed was pretty inaccurate anyway instruments of torture bloody executions witch and heretic burnings big shiny swords and pretty golden reliquaries are the stars of the film it could have just as easily been one of those conantype sword and sorcery movies only with period costumes
