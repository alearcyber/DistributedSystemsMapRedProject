NEG alleged scream queen debbie rochon and her group of frontier prostitutes travel west to the title location and encounter grisly killings that turn out to be the work of a cult of exconfederate psychopaths attempting to resurrect the south through pointless massacrebr br action and suspense take a backseat to loads of boring dialog and uninteresting character developmentbr br billy drago is good in the thankless not to mention pointless role of the town mortician but everything else about this wannabe slasher western is extremely poor including the town and the fort both of which look like modern made western tourist traps and costumes that look like they were bought at party citybr br do yourself a big favor and watch ravenous instead
