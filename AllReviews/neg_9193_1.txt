NEG wow  thank god i was on an airplane and could look out the window bad hollywood fire scenes predictable terribly acted who the hell was that awful woman who played the wife badly casted awfully written this movie was apparently made to appeal to the type of person whos willing to kneel at the alter of either firemen specifically heroes or gods in general i suppose i just dont have enough bad things to say about this film it couldnt have been cheap either with all the stars that were in it plus all those special effects and fire scenes had to have cost a fortune yet it still sucked worse than any movie i can even remember seeing funeral scene astonishingly bad courtship between fireman and aforementioned awful woman corny contrived trite firehouse pranks dont we all wish we could be both so manly and churlish at the same time
