NEG such a bs movie its just some stupid antirussian propaganda with a completely bs plot not in any way related to the book br br it looks like the production team got more money from the people who ordered the movie than they will ever be able to get from selling the movie the plot of the movie includes references to some of the real recent events in russian and other parts of eastern europe but puts them in such way that has nothing to do with reality it looks like the movie is a brainwashing instrument which helps to portray russia as a place populated by evil people that always dream about killing someone br br an of course there are hundreds of stupid mistakes like using the map of ussr instead of russia when running news reports showing a crowd with ukrainian flags and commenting that its russian elections etc br br also there are many bizarre episodes ie a character runs though the red square in moscow and in a second he is in downtown sophia bulgaria
