NEG this movie has got to be one of the alltime lows of michael j foxs generally respectable career i should have known how awful this movie was when i rented it and found the movie only half viewed and not rewound by the previous renter never a good sign fox plays a grown up child star whos now an agent for other show business kids his character is delusional in that he still believes that everyone should love him for being mikey his big break comes when he meets angie vega a talented child vega is abrasive and not at all likeable in fact the only likeable character in the whole movie is cyndi lauper as a brooklyn accented receptionist for the agency one of those movies that makes me want to stick a postit note to the box warning others not to waste their time
