NEG cannibal ferox  outta  stars miserable excuse for a movie which you might enjoy if you really like boring nonsensical jungle movies spiced up with scenes of graphic violence a pair of drug dealers on the run from the mob travel to the jungles of paraguay to search for emeralds and cocaine they meet up with another young traveler and his two hot babe sidekicks one of whom is an anthropologist seeking to prove definitively that cannibalism does not and has not ever existed one of the two dealers turns out to be a bit of a psychopath and he tortures and kills a couple of natives in order to get them to tell him where they hide their jewels and how they could even tell him when he doesnt seem to speak their language in the first place well the natives are suddenly not too thrilled with white folks in their jungle and capture them all for some retaliatory torture poor acting poor plot and poor direction not a decent moment of suspense in the whole dreary  minutes even the special effects are not particularly convincing though a couple of shots will still make most viewers cringe the only good scene in the whole movie is when the two women are imprisoned in a mud hut and seem to touch the hearts of the natives with their rendition of red river valley the following is a quote from the movie but i wouldnt be surprised if many viewers werent saying exactly the same thing by that point oh god please let her die soon oh let her die soon and let me die soon too please
