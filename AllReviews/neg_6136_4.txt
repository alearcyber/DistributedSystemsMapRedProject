NEG jumpin butterballs this movie stinks its a dull and listless drag that never lets up its a wonder anyone even bothered to make groucho up in his bizarre trademark eyebrows and mustache as he has nothing witty or outrageous to do or say throughout this bore chico must have been so disinterested that he forgot to use his italian accentbr br only harpo provides a grin or two and theres precious little of that to go around here anyway figure in a loudmouthed hotel manager and another obnoxious cocomic in frank albertson and the road gets even bumpier br br a real misfire
