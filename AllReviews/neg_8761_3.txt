NEG revenge of the zombies is a pretty weak and barely passable zombie effortbr br spoilersbr br traveling in the bayou larry adams robert lowery and scott warrington mauritz hugo are informed that a friend has deceased meeting with local dr von altermann john carradine he repeats the notion that they mysteriously died while they are staying there they realize that the help consists of zombies reanimated dead people who are doing the bidding of their master as the bodies pile up he reveals that he has been making the creatures for use in various experiments and all try to stop him before its too latebr br the good news this here gets very little right the opening is easily its best as its got several great marks for it from where it starts with the creepy silhouettes walking in the dark all the way through to the revelations this one works wonders for both its mystery and great imagery the big one is a really scene where the creature emerges from a coffin in a long slow and creepy shot these here are all done before the opening credits and is a fun sight the scenes in the middle where the creature reawakens inside the coffin is pretty chilling and looks really great the last big positive is the really fun ending with the sort of ending that feels reminiscent of so many universal attempts this one fits in with that style from the creepy reanimation to the real action involved near the swamp this one is fun and really works with the others to give its only real positivesbr br the bad news this one here only has a couple flaws but they are major ones the first one is the films major boredom from inactivity almost nothing happens in here mainly due to the tendency to do everything with talking rather than anything else theres only intermittent scenes relegated to the zombies yet theres nothing here that devotes any action to the film this one simply doesnt have any action and thats what hurts the film it rarely generates a scenes that keeps the interest going and at times this makes it feel a lot longer than it really is the last flaw in the film are its pathetic excuses for zombies those used to more modern fare will have a hard time getting any fear out of these creatures and they really only serve several scenes this here doesnt treat the zombies as threats making them even less frightening little screentime nonthreatening nature and unmodern behavior from these zombies really destroys this one these here are what really hurt the filmbr br the final verdict with bad zombies and hardly anything worth watching this one here is a curious effort those used to modern zombies will find little of interest in this one and come out the same as this one is while only classic horror fans are advised to give it a shotbr br todays ratingpg mild violence
