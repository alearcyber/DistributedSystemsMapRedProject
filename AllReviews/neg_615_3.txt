NEG this is a film that really makes me cringe in  mgm and looney toons were making some of their very best cartoonswith amazing animation exceptional backgrounds and great stories then in the late s a new style of animation began to appear such as the crusader rabbit series on tvanimation with extremely simplistic artwork in order to save money unfortunately columbia pictures cynical ploy worked instead of the public hating the toons as they should have many accepted them and the oscar people ampas actually gave this film the award for best animated shortgiving legitimacy for an inferior product unfortunately in the dollars and sense world of hollywood this soon began to creep into the products of legitimate studiosresulting in rather crappy cartoons later it got even worse as in addition to lousy animation and backgrounds the stories themselves became almost unbearable for adults to watch the cleverness and style of the classic cartoons were gone and for this tragedy i blame in part gerald mcboingboingone of the granddaddies of cheap cartoons the story isnt that bad but the animation is a horror and listening to the kid saying boingboing incessantly is a pain
