NEG this was just an awful movie ive watched it once when i was roughly  i am now  and i dont think i will ever forget this moviebr br i still feel sick whenever i think about it it was just everything horrible that could possibly fit in one movie i really dont understand what kind of person would enjoy this utter rubbish its not enough to simply turn off your mind to enjoy this movie i can enjoy the dumbest madefortv disney movies as much as the next person but this is something else completelybr br usually i dont like to judge a movie until i have seen it myself but believe me i am doing you a favour do not watch this movie
