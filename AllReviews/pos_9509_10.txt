POS i have seen films come and go in my yearsand when i see a disaster film i keep hoping i wont be disappointedand with this one i was not in the leastthe story of a whole country sinking into the ocean was a great concept written by sakyo komatsua novelist with intense theories on where this earth is goingthe characters were top notchand even though i am not japanesei didnt need a translator to give the idea of how people in their most desperate needs can come together for the common goodthe special effects blew me awayi was literally on the edge of my seat watching the tidal waves lava flows and land explosions that must have taken months of work to perfectas for the acting i thought yesthis is acting at its bestemotions run rampant throughout the film and i cried at the most severe scenesfor movie goers alikeyou dont need to speak or understand japanese to watch this filmyou can get the idea and feeling from each person and character to understand it well and to follow it along like you are theremy hats off to shinji higuchi for directing iti hope he can outdo his work with another mind blowing experienceas i saidfantastic film
