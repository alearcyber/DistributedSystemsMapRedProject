NEG despite the excellent cast and the potential of the story this movie fails on many levels i was convinced that the director was a beginner the movie is very poorly edited shows a lot of nonimportant and annoying flashes has very visible goofs and has no suspenseful atmosphere whatsoever the question which repeatedly popped up in my mind while watching this was so what i couldnt care less about the protagonist and what happens to him its not that the story isnt compelling its simply the way its told the movie tells the story period its like an actor who mumbles his lines without knowing what hes saying the movie simply tells the events that happen without any soul and the directors to blame he doesnt know how to make something interesting or suspenseful or enjoyable and believe me im not somebody who wants to see die hard  or  fast  crappy on the contrary i especially like slowpaced movies so i was convinced the director was a beginner but to my amazement this man has years of experience and has worked as a cinematographer or camera assistant on a lot of marvelous productions guess he had a bad year back then
