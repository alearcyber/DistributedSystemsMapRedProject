POS what can i say about this movie that has not been said by all the other comments here they pretty much sum up everything the people who love it cherish it the people who hate it well they loathe it this is the movie equivalent of marmitebr br i personally have committed every second of it to memory it is cyclical claustrophobic introspective magical and stands as being one of the most unique films ever made despite what many have stated i believe this truly is a cult movie it is a diamond in the rough just waiting to be discovered once unearthed its fantastical psychedelic visuals and incredible soundtrack will be unforgettable which is an achievement in itself one of my friends who watched it likened it more to a musical and in many respects to those who do not fully appreciate the context in which this film is made would probably get more out of it to view head as suchbr br i was always fond of the monkees especially the tv show back when it was repeated during the s my mum had recorded head for me when it was shown on tv late night as she knew i liked them i watched it a day later and it lodged in my memory until i was able to find a copy on dvd about  decades later what i would love now is a special edition it would be fascinating to get a greater insight into the making of this masterpiece we can only hope
