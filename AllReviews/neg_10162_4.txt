NEG there were many spooky westerns made in the s and early s and although this has a strong beginning it isnt one randy bowers john wayne stopping at a halfway house saloon finds it to be full of dead bodies the bartenders corpse draped over the bar holding a gun eyes watching randy from behind holes cut through eyes in a picture and a player piano playing the loveliest night of the year br br it was the result of a robbery by the marvin black gang to get ed rogers  randy is an investigator who works alone who wastes little time in getting arrested escaping with eds daughter sallys help and literally landing in the midst of the black gangs hideout behind a waterfall it all moves along fairly quickly only one too many chases after randy slow it downbr br we even get george hayes clean shaven and playing two parts marvin black the vilest villain as well as the good citizen matt the mute who communicates via handwritten messages having him play two opposite roles was a good idea but the writing down of messages thing gets old real fast even for him as he finally gives up doing it near the end saying to sally ah im fed up with this you can find george playing a vile vile double crossing villain in the serial the lost city br br i think this is the only lone star film in which the title relates to or is mentioned in the film sally offers her hand to randy and says hes not alone anymore then cut to their arms around each other as they look out facing a lake sallys running off with randy seems too abrupt and not sufficiently prepared for too much time spent on horseback escaping the sheriffbr br not that bad considering everything but not that great either id really give it a  and a half
