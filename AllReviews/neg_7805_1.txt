NEG i saw this movie unfortunately because it was the only option at that time and because david zucker was the director i saw his previous naked gun both parts airplane and top secret and i liked at least i had a good time and laughed im not saying that the movies i mentioned were master pieces but were ok i dont recall any other more stupid movie than this its incredible how hollywood industry is in total decadence if some studio spends any money to produce this awful picture then is not a surprise that this kind of histories are more common on these days this is a clear reflect of a decadent civilization where sex symbols and stupid plots are produced to entertain the common people i dont have any good to say about this film if you are planning to rent it or buy it please dont waste your money or your time avoid it no matter what even if you are fan of one of the actors does not worth it in fact this could be a very good example of what a director should avoid i wont see a zucker movie again he is planning to direct the fourth sequel of scary movie imagine that pathetic awful
