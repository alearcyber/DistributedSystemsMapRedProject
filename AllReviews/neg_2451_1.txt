NEG i think i would rather have my piles clipped with a pair of rusty clippers than bear another  minutes of this movie in fact i cannot even be bothered to go in to detail not sure how they managed to get the needles into the wooden actors to cure them better off for all concerned if they had just nuked the island after finding out about the virus that way it would have lasted as long as the commercial break and we could have moved on with our lives plus one more thing was this rubbish commissioned by the god channel as all they seemed to do was praise the bleeding lord most of the time avoid like the plague in fact i would prefer it
