POS i too was fortunate enough to see checking out with peter falk at the phoenix film festival this is an extremely sweet character driven film that leaves the audience enthralled in the applebaums plight in life more than funny each character in the family contributes priceless comic relief that not only spurs laughter but inspires a few joyful tears as well peter falk was born to play this role he plays a ish young father of three who brings his adult children together in what could possibly be one of the most important times in his and their lives the  day journey that the applebaum family takes though the delightful backdrop of new york with carefully selected characters not only leaves the audience wanting more but nourishes ones own sense of family checking out is a must see film not only for all those who cherish family but also all those who dont my thanks to the director who took the chance to bring this gift to its audience robin sly scottsdale arizona
