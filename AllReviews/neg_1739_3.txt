NEG ok let me start off by saying this isnt a horrible movie by any means its just not good i recall one poster saying the acting isnt campy its just nuanced no ive seen nuanced japanese and asian acting im sorry youre wrong this is campbr br the characters are totally unsympathetic the deaths are totally random and utterly meaningless the writing is bad im fine with suspending disbelief im fine with not having everything handed to me in terms of plot but this movie has no plot one reviewer stated this movie is set in a small town where people are going nuts over vortexes and spirals thats not a blurb thats the entire freaking film congratulations ive just saved you nearly an hour and a half there is nothing more to it no character development no plot development no explanations no resolution and not even the acceptable within the realm of jhorror lack of resolution just nothingbr br in addition the musical score is done by someone who obviously wasnt actually watching the movie at the time because its random enough to cause whiplash cognitive dissonance is one thing and done well it can be brilliant see dark water but here it just seems as if the score was designed to go with another movie all togetherbr br the best example i can give is its as if the japanese remade evil dead without any of the clever bits or good acting it just falls flat its jhorror without the horror
