POS on watching this film i was amazed at how media perception can mould a persons opinion of a celebrity karen carpenter was a carefree but very unconfident young lady whose wonderful voice helped her and her brother richard to soar the charts with wonderful songs as with all celebrities of today they were often criticised about their music as well as their looks styles etc this had a huge effect on karen who raged a battle against her eating and drastically lost weight which eventually caused her death this heart felt film was not initially something which i would have thought of watching but on starting to view it then i was hooked in the same way that the tina turner story does then this film enlightens you and allows you to see into the young performers life the acting was superb and even after nearly  years after it was made then the directional and the dialogue are still entertainingbr br i would recommend this to anyone who hasnt yet watched it it is amazingly accurate and emotionally charged
