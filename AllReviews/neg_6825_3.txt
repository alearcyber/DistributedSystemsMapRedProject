NEG when recounting these events that took place some years ago hard to believe this actually happenedi thought well there is a basis for an interesting story here many secrets were never uncovered the horse never found the main conspirators never captured etcbr br however this film seems to be distracted by character study and very little attention payed to the plot some other questions are raised though like why on earth would mickey rourke be in this film its good to see rourkes career has taken off again but he must cringe at the mention of this rubbishbr br if the subject matter interests you do an internet search on the topic youll be more educated and dare i say more entertained avoid this
