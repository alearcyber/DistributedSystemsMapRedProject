NEG there really are no redeeming factors about this show to put it simply its just terrible absolutely dreadful its just a dreadful reality show not only that its dreadful fictionbr br imagine this a bunch of overlyimaginative teenagers get together one night and go hey lets make a paranormal show just like ghost hunters and whatnot so they grab a camera harass local residents and film random landscapes behind a painfully tryingtobedramaticyetfailingmisreably monologue this show is basically a bunch of teenagers running around with a home movie camera trying to make a really bad horror documentary the only difference is this show actually has a budget and writers a wasted budget and terrible writersbr br oh the problems how do i count thee well first off lets talk about this from a personal level i am not a total skeptic when it comes to the paranormal i am willing to believe in whats paranormal and whats not and im sure there are a lot of people who feel the same so if youre going to do a show about the paranormal you have to do a good job convincing the viewer that what theyre seeing is either paranormal or not because the viewer can easily believe otherwise i hate to compare but i dont see why not at this point take ghost hunters for example in ghost hunters you can tell that the cast is leveled with the audience theyre not totally skeptical yet theyre still willing to keep the possibility of any paranormal anomalies in mind they have to look at something and be willing to say this is possible that its simply nothing and with that in mind they set out to try and prove themselves wrong they use technology and several other gadgets along with constant moderation to determine what is paranormal along with bearing the fact that what they may be monitoring could be nothing in mind not only are they trying to convince themselves what is real and what is not in the process they are trying to convince you that element of doubt is not present in paranormal state strike onebr br in paranormal state the cast simply says theres this spooky place and its haunted so were going to find some spirits and immediately you know and saying to yourself okay convince me otherwise the cast is not professional in their interviews in fact sometimes it seems like theyre just harassing local residents of these socalled haunted areas they have no real evidence to back up their claims besides assumptions and theories and the best they can must up is somebody who claims they can contact the dead with no one ever backing up who this person is and how valid they really are they could have easily just picked some random person off the street and said pretend you can contact spirits for our show and went at it in the mothman episode this just happens without any convincing evidence towards the end of the show they bring this sort of individual out where he does a random painfully scripted reading of a supposed area of how something is haunted in order to convince its audience very very poor effort i feel that one of the main problems with the show is that it feels scripted during one of the episodes the cast gets attacked by one of these paranormal anomalies at times in an attempt to be dramatic these sort of dramatic sequences would make any skeptic laugh and even those who are on the fence realize what theyre watching is just a bunch of tabloidesquire trash if the shows aim was to try and convince their audience that these paranormal events are real theyre doing a horrifically poor job at doing so strike twobr br however there is always the counter just one last viewpoint to see if the show is actually worth something what if the show isnt trying to convince you that these paranormal events are real and are simply trying to entertain you with good fiction it even fails on that level as well if the shows creators were trying to craft fiction to entertain its audience the writing is too poor and even on a fictional level it fails to convince the audience that its cast members are really experiencing the unknown in all its full horrifying glory the writing is simply not compelling and even dare i say boring strike threebr br so what remains of this show is simply a bunch of teenagers who are too willing or too gullible to believe in the paranormal simply because its simply much more amazing than reality who set out with a camera a bad script and bad actors to generally just make a really bad horror documentary thats all the show is at this point there is no reason to see it not even for the entertainment factor and theres no reason to care about it to be blunt its lame there are absolutely no redeeming factors about this show
