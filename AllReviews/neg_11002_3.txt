NEG the fanglys is set in a small texan town called layton on the eve of halloween as the townspeople treat it like the second coming of christ or something i mean halloween isnt that important is it anyway sheriff pete burton gilliam has been called out to yet another murder as local boy ned coassociate producer john william galt has discovered a body in the local woods could it be the fang lady justin hamilton the central character involved in a local legend about a witch who kills teenagers who knows being the fun sort of guy he is mark asisstant director  producer robert harvey convinces his missus kelly laurie reeves to ride out to a cemetery that his mate steven josh gobin found the night before for a halloween party the idea of spending the night in a cemetery in the middle of the woods obviously appeals to kelly  she agrees along with steven  a girl he picked up named camille natalie woods  their nerdy friend jerry tim boswell they all set out for a night of fun well as much fun as you can expect to have in an isolated cemetery however they soon discover that the legend of the fang lady is far from the bedtime story many make outbr br edited executive produced written  directed by christopher abram the fanglys is a pretty rubbish attempt at a horror film the script is very predictable dull  doesnt deliver any sort of entertainment value whatsoever in the right hands  with a decent budget the fanglys could have been an effective horror film but as it is it isnt it moves along at a fair pace but the onscreen action is so poor that it doesnt matter i dont quite know what else to say other than the fanglys is a really bad film  i cant see anyone getting any sort of enjoyment out of it the dialogue is basic the characters are clichd  lifeless while as a whole the film seems a lot longer than the  minutes running time there are a few lame attempts at humour which dont sit that well along side the horror elements  what was that retard keeping in that cage id imagine the budget didnt allow the filmmakers to show it oh if you want to know what happens to jerry at the end then youll have too keep watching past the end credits as the lame truth is revealed assuming you can actually make it that far of course believe me it takes some doingbr br director abram doesnt do anything special abram thinks bathing scenes in neon light is stylish i can tell him that it isnt when your film is supposed to be set in the woods theres no atmosphere scares tension excitement or any of the elements that makes a good horror film good forget about decent gore theres a bit when someone eats some skin off an arm  a pitchfork stuck through someones throatbr br apparently the fanglys had a filming budget of  which makes it one of the lowest budget films ever to have a commercial release  to be brutally honest it shows what about the retarded guy  his false joke shop teeth that look ridiculous the terrible special effects the camcorder cinematography  the terrible acting from everyone involved that makes it even more of a pain to sit throughbr br the fanglys is straighttovideo crap it has no redeeming features whatsoever  its low imdb user rating score is fully justified its one of those films that within half an hour i was looking at the clock  wishing the thing would just finish
