POS i enjoyed the movie very much everything in the italian job is simple an explosive guy a safecracker a computer genius a wheelman and a man with a spectacular plan of stealing  million without using a gun this film is entertaining although it has no central idea it is a nonstop movie with lots of actions all the stunt work is gorgeous from the speedboat chase in venice at the beginning to the chase on the busy roads in los angeles involving three mini coopers and even a helicopter the best boast chase i have ever seen i like the mini coopers the expert thieves used mini coopers for the getaway cars the chase between the mini coopers and the motorbikes is amazing they chased underground i can say there was not a moment i was bored mark wahlberg charlie croker charlize theron stella bridger donald sutherland john bridger jason statham handsome rob seth green lyle mos def left ear and edwin norton steve really did a good job i like the actors in this film i have seen a lot of heist movie but the italian job is one of my favourites a great hollywood action movie without a drop of blood after all i do love this kind of movie
