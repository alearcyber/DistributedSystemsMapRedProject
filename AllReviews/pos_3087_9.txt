POS i remember when i first saw this movie i was babysitting for a friend of my mums and one of the kids suggested we watch it thinking it was the frankly laughable prince of thieves they were slipping into the video recorder i was prepared for a few hours of boredom what i got came as a shock a pleasant one ill admit but still a shockbr br now you all know the robin hood legend dont you i shall explain a little robin hood was a saxon criminal nicking money here and there and giving it to people who needed it all the while seducing the beautiful maid marion and vexing the sheriff of nottingham and prince john thats the basics now on with the reviewbr br this movie was released in  and is a take off of the whole robin hood legend and a p take of prince of thieves in particularbr br loosely following the legend robin of loxley is first encountered in an arabic prison during the third century crusades and together with a moor as they were called in those days he executes a cunning escape with a cellmate asneezebr br after escaping asneeze beseeches robin to find his son atchoo a foreign exchange student in england and look out for him this robin vows to do robin swims back to englandbr br he returns to his home loxley castle to find it being wheeled away on the back of the cart by bailiffs and goes through he sorrowful revelation that his father dog cat and even the goldfish are all dead desperate for a familiar face he finds the familys loyal blind servant blinkin sitting on the toilet with a jazz mag in braille the hilarity continues throughout the moviebr br as with all robin hood stories robin must thwart the evil plans of prince john and the sheriff of rottingham who are wreaking havoc and charging exorbitant taxes on king richardss kingdom while hes awaybr br those familiar with the movies mel brooks has previously directed will have some small idea of what to expect after all this is the man responsible for draculadead and loving it and young frankenstein all the jokes which range from visual gags to wonderful witty comments are in exactly the right places throughout the movie with never more than a minute between laughsbr br cary elwes incidentally the only english man to play robin hood in a movie who many of you will know from princess bride brings his cheeky grinning twinkle eyed presence to this movie and does a wonderful job from outlandish heroic posturing to a wickedly sexy glance he really is amazingly funny and the man looks better in tights than i dobr br richard lewis is hilarious as the whiny arrogant prince john with the everchanging mole he gets the sissyboy behaviour down to a tee and his whinging american vocalisations are great all the way through the movie a mole on his face constantly changes position it starts on his left cheek then over to his right cheek then his chin then his forehead before going back to its original place this is a subtle joke based on the mole on alan rickman when he played the sheriff in prince of thievesbr br roger rees as the sleazy sheriff of rottingham is marvellously slimy and nasty and has some great lines throughout the filmbr br there are some faces here youll be familiar with from other brooks films for instance robert ridgely playing the hangman in this film also played the hangman in blazing saddles another film directed by brooks he likes to add subtle references to his earlier films too with several in this film that diehard brooks fans will easily spot those who watched history of the world part  will recognise the music to the song men in tights also when patrick stewart arrives and snogs marion mel himself playing rabbi tuckman utters the line its good to be a king one of his lines in history of the worldbr br the whole cast is wonderfully comedic even those with only a few lines bring a great depth of warmth and humour to thembr br what makes this film so wonderfully warm and funny in my own opinion are all the improvised scenes although there was a script of sorts some scenes were completely improvised by the actors themselves such as the scene where latrine tracey ullman prays for rottingham in her bed and he falls through the ceiling landing right where she wanted him which was totally devised and thought out by the two actorsbr br there are few special effects and those that are there are small but fun moments of computerised camera trickerybr br the soundtrack is memorable with some very funny songs and a couple of cheesy love songs youll be singing men in tights or at least humming it to yourself for weeksbr br the rating is pg to which i say bah humbug there is no bad language in the film except in the use of double entendre and one utterance of sht and violence is minimal in fact id go as far as to say nonexistent apart from a few comedy fight scenesbr br a great fun film that adults and children alike will enjoy
