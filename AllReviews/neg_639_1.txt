NEG i am a big fan of scifi movies so when i saw this movie in the epg i thought i was in for a pleasant evening what a disappointment  such a poor display of special effects i could not imagine in  but in   come on why would you do special effects of an helicopter flying in the desert when you can film a real one for a much lower price i guess  and those killer muppets well i could do better than that in a couple of hours in the garage you can expect to have a low budget on a movie but i dont think its reasonable to have a low movie for any budget as for the star of the movie i use a lot of quotes tonight lou diamond philips the guy is not even remotely an actor maybe he should have stayed to the martial arts movies all in all an awful movie maybe i am in a bad mood tonight then again maybe not a sincere  out of
