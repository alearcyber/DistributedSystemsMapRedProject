POS this is a thoughtful film that lays bare the inequities of the socalled upper class and those who work for them the haves and havenots robert shaw does a creditable job in his role as the obliging correct chauffeur steven ledbetter who helps lady franklin sarah miles overcome her mental depression at the outset however steven has many mixed feelings regarding this lady of the upper class he inevitably falls in love with her which of course is overstepping the societal boundaries that separate thembr br i have not read anything prior to this and only judge the movie as i have seen it i consider it a very honest story about the realities of daily living and the conflict of what we might wish or expect from life and what we get its a fine drama worth seeing again
