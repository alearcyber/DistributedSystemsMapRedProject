NEG i made sure to see this film because it is a s scifi filmone of my favorite genres unfortunately while i was looking forward to either bugeyed aliens or powermad conquerers the aliens in this film were a major disappointment first you only see one very briefly at the beginning and he looked pretty ordinary and you also only got a tiny glimpse of a spaceship second the alien was neither the evil conquerer or the benevolent friend of mankindbut a real oddball and finally the plot itself seemed so dumb preachy and heavyhanded that it elicited more yawns than thrillsbr br as the film begins five people from five different parts of the world germany britain russia china and the usa are kidnapped by an alien the alien gives each of them devices by which they can destroy all life on the planet if they so choosebecause the alien admits that his race of people would love to inhabit the earth but they themselves wont kill to get it then he returns them all while its  obvious that no one would want to use these devices the alien then announces on tv the identities of the five without telling that the weapons are that powerful so all the militarists in the world want to find the five and force them to reveal how the weapons work much of the rest of the film consists of some of the five going into hiding and one being tortured to get him to reveal how the device worksas the soviets want to use it this part of the film just seemed pretty silly sure the ussr was an evil and corrupt nation sorry but its factespecially under stalin they never would have thought of using it like they did in the movie later one of the five the german scientist somehow figures out that the devices can also be used to kill only all the evil people who hate freedom so he uses it to wipe out all the evil commies and presumably others who were antifreedom and the world then becomes a paradise preachy silly and full of plot holesthis movie just isnt worth your time though it is an interesting relic simply for the way it addresses communismin particular the tensions between nato and the soviets
