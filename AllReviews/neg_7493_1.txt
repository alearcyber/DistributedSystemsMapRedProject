NEG after spending half an hour examining rumors a gay bar located outside tupelo mississippi small town gay bar shifts focus to the murder of scotty weaver in bay minette in order to demonstrate the risks run by the interview subjects but there is a problem here bay minette isnt near tupelo as the film implies it isnt even in the same state it is actually about three hundred miles away in coastal alabamabr br director malcom ingram doesnt exactly rush to point out this fact nor does he bother to mention that while bay minette itself is little more than a wide spot in the road it is actually about two deep breaths away from the major metro area of mobile alabamawhich has a noticeable gay community quite a few gay bars and even a congregation of metropolitan community church if ingram is disingenuous on these points one has to ask if he is on others as wellbr br speaking as someone who was born raised and continues to live in mississippi i have to say that i find most of small town gay bar a lot of hooey neither meridian nor tupelo the communities upon which ingram focuses are as rural small or as isolated as he would have you imagine and gay bars are indeed more common in the state than the film implies that said ingram rather blithely ignores the fact that the absence of a gay bar does not mean an absence of a gay community and in doing so he demonstrates a rather profound ignorance of southern culture which tends to hold those who frequent barsbe they gay or straightin low esteembr br small town gay bar is in my opinion an instance in which a film maker came to his subject with a personal agenda in hand and then proceeded to film the agenda do gays and lesbians living in rural mississippi face major sometimes frightening challenges you bet they dobut thats no excuse for fiddling with reality to such a degree the dvd includes a commentary track and a number of deleted scenes but i found the feature film itself so ridiculous that i didnt waste any time on thembr br gft amazon reviewer
