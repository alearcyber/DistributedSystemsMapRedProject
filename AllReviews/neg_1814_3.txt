NEG overall the movie heart of darkness was pitiful compared to the book anyone who has ever read the book and had a sufficient understanding of it would be able to see the countless obvious flaws there is an immeasurable difference between the two it seems to me that the director was walking into a losing battle i couldnt imagine that someone would take on the monstrous task of recreating heart of darkness the immense detail and magic of the story would be impossible to justly interpret conrads story had so many layers and so much depth that it would seem pointless to try to make a visual interpretationbr br first capturing the details of the story is unattainable the colossal fine points created by joseph conrad cannot be rightfully recreated through film marlows feelings and emotions cannot be equally construed in the movie if you have taken on the enormous task of tackling conrads work then you know as well as i that conrad only wrote half the story the additional half is a series of connections made by the reader you as the reader are required to be capable of inferring and connecting joseph conrads ideas as a result several crucial details are absent in the moviebr br also although the movie was an adequate length the film seemed short it seemed that conrad was able to pack many more details into  pages than the movie could pack in an hour and a half the speed of the movie kept the viewer from getting to know the characters marlow was much more of a stranger the viewpoint of the book puts you into marlows shoes however in the movie youre almost watching marlow from a distance i began to think that the director was trying to utilize the same read between the lines method as conrad did however the connections were weak i know that if i had not read the book then i would in no way be able to begin to understand the depth of the situation and the charactersbr br finally kurtz also seemed to be interpreted incorrectly his role was short and the details werent all included it was impossible to comprehend the true kurtz in the length of time he was shown an important detail in the book was that kurtz had become a god to the africans i didnt think that significant detail was defined also in the book kurtz represented a soulless being he had died inside long ago i believe the director comprehended this detail however instead of recreating it he just had kurtz mope around and mumble everything moreover it seemed like the director attempted to make kurtz seem mysterious however instead he seemed entirely unidentifiedbr br altogether this movie reminded me of a teenager cramming to finish a science project due the next day it appeared to have been crafted effortlessly and in hardly any time the characters were alienated crucial details were left out and overall the central plot was lost in translation
