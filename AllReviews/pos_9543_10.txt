POS i avoided this film as a boy because i thought it would be boringno fights or shooting cops robbers cowboys or indians it was definitely not a cool film to like so i didnt see trc until i was in my twenties and found it one of the most beautiful captivating films i have seen all the actors deliver the characterisations perfectly and each emotion is drawn from the viewer scene by scene the filming and direction are deceptively simple but feel so natural and drew me completely into the story my two favourite scenes are bobbies birthday party and the scene on the station platform near the end directed and edited to perfection the quality and phrasing of jenny agutters voice when she calls daddy my daddy wrenches emotion from the viewer tears are welling in my eyes as i think of itbr br this adaptation isnt just a movie it is a piece of precious art as well as being the perfect example of what all film makers should be striving to achievecreation of an emotional experience
