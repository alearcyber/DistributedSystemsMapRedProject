POS edith nesbitts best book has been adapted into a truly magnificent film i love it the film itself has gorgeous cinematography and fine realisation of the subject matter the ending is enough to have you in tears as it is so beautifully done lionel has directed some truly excellent films like the amazing mr blunden but this is his best film as director by a mile the costumes were absolutely lovely that matched the beauty of the countryside and the sparkling and convenientlyfaithful script helped matters however it is the quality of the acting that holds this film together as it is nothing shorter than incredible dinah sheridan is suitably sincere as the mother a muchneeded characteristic of the character and bernard cribbins was hilarious as perks in fact i preferred perks on film as he isnt as humorous in the book the children were perfect gary warren and sally thomsett both gave spirited performances but it is jenny agutters enchanting portrayal of bobbie that impressed me the most another special mention is the gorgeous music by johnny douglas the title music reminded me of charlie chaplins smile in conclusion a funny and poignant masterpiece that is better than the book i think  bethany cox
