NEG starts off with fulci playing a version of himself writing down some ideas for how people could die followed by a fakelooking cat eating what is presumably a brain the copy i watched was dubbed in english which i always hate but i was particularly disappointed not to get to hear fulci in his own voicebr br fulci is in a sort of feverish state working on his latest horror movie his stomach turns when he sees things that resemble effects from his movie and he starts to hallucinate that he is witnessing acts of horror he visits a psychiatrist who hypnotizes him and unfortunately he does not have his improved mental health in mind i was reminded of the psychiatrist played by david cronenberg in clive barkers nightbreed  the shrink in this one is played by david l thompson who is pretty bad probably a real life friend of fulcis he has a big toothy grin when he kills people though this may be fulcis black humor at work which i thought was pretty poor toobr br the movie is composed of a lot of clips from fulcis movies either as if fulci is on the set directing them watching recordings on tvs or witnessing the acts ive never been too much of a fan of clip shows in tv series and i also think things like charles bands full moon entertainment cutting their old films down and putting three such cuts together as new anthologies are pretty lame i guess they need to make moneybr br the shrink in cat in the brain makes reference to the theory that violence in movies begets violence in real life one of fulcis coworkers talks about having a documentary crew follow fulci to see what his life is like lots of selfreferential stuff like thisbr br in the end some of the characters sail away on a boat named perversion
