NEG as we are well aware movies are not set out to be a direct incorporation of history but it is a disgrace when a movie is made which has absolutely little to no correlation i wish the director andor the screen writer had done hisher research in this topic all this movie does is create a forum for hate between people while causing a rift that should not be there this movie portrayed the sikhs and muslims in a very negative manor while making the third group hindus look as if they were non existent in the brutal killings of the people of both nations the inaccuracies coupled with the sear disregard for ones faith as portrayed by gian singh was a disgrace to the highest format though on a more positive note the actors did a great job in acting in their roles both kristen k and neve c played their rolls exceptionally i hope those that watch this movie do not see or use it as a template for the actual historical event
