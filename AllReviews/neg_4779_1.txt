NEG i have to say that this movie was not what i expected even though i have not read the book the fact that plants can one bait and then wait for a killing to happen only to have it drag off a corpse for lunch is about the worst scenario anyone has come up with with the title ruins you would think that out of  years that some kind of deity or ancient animal or god would be the culprit this is like another movie primeval where you would think it was something strange that villagers fear the most but not a crocodile either way this film was like that it entices you to think about ruins of mayan or inca folklore resulting in awakening and old god or the people had another agenda for sacrifice or something to that effect but plants come on is there nothing else producers can come up with to wow a crowd as for this movie it will hit the b list in no time i have to say that some of the gore was excellent to see but it didnt make up for the rest of the film and a plant mimicking a cell phone sound or peoples voices is just too much to be believed i am a fan of horror films but i am not a stereo typed fan who relies on just gore or mechanical effects i do rely on great suspense and whats the next scene going to bring for more suspense the thing had a better story line than this did even the ring had me jumping for more but the ruins is just that ruined for using a plant to coax victims into killing or be killed by the villagers the premise was alright for the villagers to keep it at bay with salt and such but still a simple blow torch and lots of napalm can easily do the trick to end those pesky plants with a flesh eating disorder
