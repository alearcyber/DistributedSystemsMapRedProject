NEG i as a christian am outraged after seeing just the first half of this picture the films website says they researched the movie before writing but i believe they forgot to consult the ultimate source the bible i sat with two different versions of the bible and could not find half of what happened or was said in this picture it was like they made up what was not in the bible and changed what was in the bible to what they thought modern film viewers would want to see instead of the truth i personally am too young to remember the s ten commandments but it cant be any worse than this i have written to the network and can only hope they publicly apologize for this travesty
