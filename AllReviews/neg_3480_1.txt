NEG being a fan of bad movies i was thrilled to find a  pack of crppy horror at best buy today the set was cheap and included a terrible film called the dark that i actually remember seeing in the theaterbr br the remaining  were equally as bad creatures from the abyss being probably the worst of the bunch since they were all bad that isnt saying much but its stupidity bad acting terrible effects and retarded storyline actually made this one a lot of fun to watch i was rolling on the floor with each new plot development the discovery of the abandon ship the missing crew the realization that there was something terribly wrong it was great of course everyones favorite scene seems to be the sex scene omg i almost lost it between that an the monster cam i have to say i enjoyed this film a lotbr br i am a fan of bad movies so i enjoyed it but in all fairness i did have to give the movie a  it was awful but if rubbish is your bag at least rent this one yes the bad pun was intentional
