POS mr bean has shaped the face of british tv comedy he has proved that you do not need wicked words or wit a massive budget a great deal of intelligence or even any intelligence to make something brilliant and mr bean is one of those characters who you just cant forget some of these episodes had me in stitches  yes theyre not realistic at all and theyre all pretty stupid but to be honest realism is one of the barriers bean has broken on its way to greatness rowan atkinson and co always manage to cook up interesting new ideas  and hilarious new gags  remember when mr bean drove his green mini whilst sitting on a sofa on the roof mr bean is one of those things that never gets weak  the movie wasnt as good as this but bean has introduced a distinct new sense of humour to the world and kids and adults alike will marvel at its immense fun factor extras and little britain can be damned  this is british comedy at its best and most original these escapades never get old
