POS i have been hooked on gg since midway through  nd season when i tuned in to see smallville  minutes early thanks to beginnings i now have all but  episodes on tape right up through last night ep  i am a middleaged straight male and this is the only weekly tv show i watchbr br  i love this series because a lauren graham is a damn finelooking woman and funny and smart to boot b the dialogue is extremely wellwritten c it is flatout hilarious putting overrated garbage like everybody loves raymond to shame many current tv comedies have been heavily influenced by the highly successful and muchdespised slimepit known as married with children where the viewer is encouraged to deride and feel superior to the characters in gg the characters have faults but we can see our own foibles in them and laugh with them not at them this is stimulating tv where the writers challenge us to keep up with rapidfire exchanges and outofleftfield popcultureliteraturecurrent events references i get immense pleasure out of watching these episodes over and over again catching all the oneliners and references to previous episodes stars hollow is its own little world one that i will happily continue to visit as long as the series runs
