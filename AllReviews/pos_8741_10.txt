POS starting on or around  american movies took a turn for the shocking and the iconoclastic which was great for the times  sort of the seeds that would pave the way for grittier daring dramas however because the very decade that gave birth to these films was so ruled by its own convictions most all of the films released at this period have dated cactus flower is no exception its very title suggests a sunny romantic comedy with occasional lapses into the risqu this is not to say that its a bad thing quite the contrary films about risqu subject matter have to begin somewhere and america being a culture rooted in specific traditions themselves laced in deep hypocrisies shocks itself for the sake of it when seeing an indirect reflection of the mores of the time meanwhile european films address these same situations walk off looking like a million bucks and have a longer shelflife because what we consider scandalous they shrug off say next and move on br br toni simmons goldie hawn in her breakout role a young very sixties bright young thing is carrying on with a mucholder dentist named julian winston walter matthau who has commitment issues he canr marry her hes already married toni decides instead of wilting away she actually wants to meet his wife and set things straight into the picture comes his assistant stephanie dickinson a luminous ingrid bergman returning to american cinema after a twentyyear absence a woman closer to his age who acts as if she and he had the perfect marriage and household there is a reason for this she has harbored quiet emotions for julian emotions he is unaware of even when he asks her to play his wife to ward toni off from wanting to step their relationship further and then he steps it up a notch when tonis blissfully innocent actions veer the action off into the unexpected and he introduces harvey greenfield jack weston as stephanies lover by the way harvey is also an older gent who is having an affair with a much younger woman eve bruce whom he also lies to in one very funny scenebr br its funny how the person whom were looking for is the one whos always been there what could have been a thankless role for rick lenz who plays igor sullivan tonis next door neighbor turns into the man who not only sees the true beauty in fellow outcast stephanie but the one who saves toni at the start from killing herself not the stuff of comedy suicide then again this is not your average comedy and needless to say is ingrid bergmans subtle poignant portrayal of a woman whos somehow missed her chances at love whos become prickly who due to a lie said to another she becomes the real person she was always meant to be i cant imagine anyone else in this quiet but deep rolebr br movies like these can be enjoyed at facevalue and seen as escapist fun  a product of its times  or be viewed for the deep symbolism that like its title it carries deep within its a tricky film the same way hawns and bergmans performance are equally tricky because in seeming so simple devoid of flourish and pose neither come out and proclaim what they are about their acting becomes not really acting but playing real people warts and all cactus flower is a story that never appears to take itself too seriously but reveals itself to be deep and very human after all
