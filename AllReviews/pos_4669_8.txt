POS heres another pleasant surprise whenever i hear a movie is being remade i cringe movies such as gone in sixty seconds and the day of the jackal get remade and the results are less than stellar so when i heard that the italian job was getting remade i expected it to be badbr br well i had the opportunity to calm down read some reviews and finally see the movie and was proven wrong granted its not original and predictable but its sure fun from beginning to end you are taken on one very fun ride the scenes with the minis are great and the characters actually enjoy themselvesbr br so even if there are some flaws who cares as long as its funbr br overall  out of  the only points lost are maybe the a few details and a slight lack of realism but youll be having so much fun you wont even be given a chance to stop and notice
