POS my brother got me hooked on carlin back in the s i always loved his observational humor that is looking at every day things and finding the humor in it like asking the questionhave you ever tried to throw away an old waste basket you cant do it they keep bringing back to you and asking questions like why is the word kill more acceptable then the f word while making prefect sense with the discussionbr br however during the s his stuff was less funny and more angry what he seemed to be doing was holding a mirror to societys face and say take a look at this point his shows were less of a comedy show and more of a gripe session but in all fairness he always made a tremendous amount of sense he really made you thinkbr br here was carlin old and new he starts out about the fun one could have by getting old and later slamming the the state of the world again making perfect sensebr br this was his best since jammin in new york and as it turns out his lastbr br i think what the shootist was to john wayne or a prairie home companion to robert altman its bad for ya is to george carlin a fond farewell to a true great icon love him or hate him i think he will be remembered
