POS pola x is a beautiful adaption of herman melvilles pierre or the ambiguities the comments on here surprise me it makes me wonder what has led to the overwhelmingly negative reaction br br the shock value is the least appealing thing about this film  a minor detail that has been blown out of proportion the story is of pierres downfall  and the subsequent destruction of those around him  which is overtly demonstrated in his features demeanour and idiolect the dialogue and soundtrack set this film apart from any other i have seen and turn a fundamentally traditional storyline with controversial twists into an unforgettably emotional epicbr br i cant stress enough the importance of disregarding everything you have heard about this film and watching as i did with an open mind you will i hope be rewarded in the same way that i was i felt on edge and nervous from around the halfhour mark however the film is far from scary in any traditional sense it will leave you with  thoughts each of them at once troublesome and thrilling i know im gushing here but i feel the need to make up for the negative perception of this film its the best ive seen all year
