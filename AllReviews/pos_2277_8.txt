POS japan takes the best from around the world and makes it their own while that may be true it applies to all except for one thing that beingmajor league baseballbut not to worry mr baseball is there to try and change all that but just who will change whom is the part of the movie that really makes it rock tom selleck is one of my favorite actors and really shineson in his comedic roles the storyline may be true to life however the subplot is deadon the japanese people are a gentle respectful people with ways and traditions very different than those of western society all of these elements and obstacles combine to make for one truly enjoyable funny film its definitely worth the watch
