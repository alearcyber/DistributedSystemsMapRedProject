POS has the proliferation of relatively high quality shows on the proliferating tv networks made it possible for people to produce direct finance andor star in their own films who might otherwise not have been able to is that a good thing br br this film does not answer the latter question either way but it does appear that without curb jeff garlin would not have been able to make i want someone to eat cheese with br br like most new producersdirectors jeff garlins independent piece heaves a heavily more sensitive sigh than the vehicle he is primarily known for curb and yet is it a sensitive guy film he isnt really a sensitive guy likable sure relatable indeed br br what this film really is about is a bit hard to say i can only relate what i took away from it br br i rented the film because of the trailers particularly the scene of a counselor portrayed by amy sedaris informing james aaron garlin that a particular woman is interested in him mainly because she is a chubby chaser i just about fell out of my seat based on that scene alone i ran to my computer to write a note to myself to rent this movie the reason  i thought the school counselor sedaris was talking about beth portrayed by sarah silverman i imagined a lightish romantic comedy between the foxy silverman and the fat garlin i didnt think the story would be anything original but that the dialogue would be snappy and the scenes would move along at a satisfying pace in short i thought it would be a comedy br br it was intriguing that the film started out that way but then took a much much more realistic turn when beth gives james the heave ho because ive never really been with a fat guy before that is how brutally we live life and it was completely realistic i applaud the decision it just meant that beth has now left the building and with her the one snappy person in the filmbr br jamess relationship with his mother was also interesting that part made me wonder if the whole concept did not start out as a play it had that intricate feel to it the whole marty movie within a movie thing was utterly lost on me as i have never seen that filmbr br there were serious doubts i had about the character of james aaron though is it really possible that at  he had not had a serious relationship and he is an actor that did not really square with me to me his persona was less actory and more corporate i could not really buy his ordinariness either no doubt he was extremely disappointed that things with beth did not work out we felt that but then did he really care br br another thing  how in the world can both he and his mother afford to move out at the same time hasnt he just lost his job the last one he had that was one reason he did not seem ordinary to me wheres the funding for his life coming from br br and yet i have read reviews that talk about the realistic portrayal of urban loneliness so there is that yes it is very realistic the way we must be satisfied with what we have because it is all that we have the way we sort of disappear from ourselves and each other in interactions james and stella some kind of selfeffacement that takes place just to move on to the next moment that contrasted with the possibility of defining ourselves through our moments our thoughts the way james had with beth its really crushingbr br very well done
