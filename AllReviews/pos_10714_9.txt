POS what can i say about kramer vs kramer on the surface its rather simple but underneath it deals with emotions greater than life itself it delivers many fantastic moments it makes you laugh it makes you cry you sympathize with the characters and you care about them many films fail at this kramer vs kramer is a successbr br i think everyone would agree the acting is superb once you watch kramer vs kramer for some time the acting in most other films starts to feel plastic and unemotional the actors seem to get along well with their roles and the characters really live on the screen theres some beautiful chemistry between them i think the best performance in the film comes from the young justin henry hes different from any other child actor ive ever seen hes amazingly naturalbr br also theres some kind of neurotic beauty in meryl streep and dustin hoffman delivers one of the best performances of his career the story is very well written its simple but complicated at the same time the concept is the simple part the feelings associated is the complicated part of itbr br if you havent seen this film yet youre definitely missing out see it now
