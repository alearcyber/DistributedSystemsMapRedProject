POS once a year in america saturday morning would give way to new cartoons usually sometime in america just about the time school startedbr br i guess this was to make not having school on saturdays that more bearablebr br one friday night before the premiere of the new saturday morning cartoons a movie came onbr br at the earths core i had not a clue who cushing nor mcclure were clearly they were not from the same country so i couldnt grasp why they were traveling togetherbr br i do recall seeing the mechanism in the firebreathing monsters mouthbr br what connects this movie for me is the opening with the molten metal and then suddenly we get the band playing as we see the factorybr br how do you end a movie like this the music again and two bewlidered cops as the drill appears behind thembr br whatever reason i remember watching this movie more that friday night than i do any new cartoon that came on the following morningbr br that was definitely the late seventiesbr br it would be during jurassic park mania cicra  i believe before i would see this movie againbr br yes people in costumes there was the firebreather againbr br still loved the ending with the two copsbr br finally it would be nearly another decade before i would send off for the movie on dvdbr br now i would just watch the beginning and introbr br oh i do love much of the movie of all these sci fi jules verne hg wells erb movies this one stands as my favebr br what i note now is that one of the cops begins turning around a wee bit too soon then turns back then he and the other cop are synchronized as they turn inward once again to look behind themselves at the drillbr br perhaps for me this movie stands as the best of the saturday morning shows which is why i enjoy it so much
