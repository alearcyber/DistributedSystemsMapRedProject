NEG sorry folks but all of you that say this is a great documentary and that award it won at sundance well youve all been duped ive heard for a few years how i had to see this documentary and i finally watched it maybe in  when it came out and reality tv didnt have such a dominant presence in the industry this movie would have seemed entertaining but mike and mark are so obviously playing themselves mike and mark at times they are funny and some of the lines seem off the cuff but mostly they do not ring true they are the reality version of jay and silent bob yes the people are real they are not actors but its put on its exaggeration of themselves and its so obvious that its hard to believe so many people think its the real deal i wasnt fooled so it was actually a tad boring mildly amusing but not missing much if you miss it
