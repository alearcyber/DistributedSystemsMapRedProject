POS this offbeat horror movie seems to be getting nothing but bad reviews my question is why i think this movie is pretty good dee snider did very well for his first and only time directing he also plays the antagonist captain howdy carelton hendriks this movie seems to have a view of the future although it came out back in  it seems to be about modern issues internet predators seems to be the underlying plot here although taken to another level this is an issue which we still face today ill admit the story fell short a few times but that doesnt make this a bad movie at all robert englund is even in this movie that automatically makes it better the acting wasnt bad the characters were pretty good as well hendriks was a pretty good antagonist i think i give this offbeat horror a  recommend for fans of saw
