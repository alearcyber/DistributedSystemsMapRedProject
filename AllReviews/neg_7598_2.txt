NEG when i first saw this dvd in a bargain bin for three dollars i really couldnt believe my luck a christmas movie starring tori spelling william shatner and gary coleman needless to say i snatched it up immediately and considered it a worthwhile investmentbr br the movie itself was just as bad as any movie youd expect to be combining christmas and the three aforementioned celebrities the dialogue was inane the characters were one dimensional and carols character arc was completely unbelievable the movie itself was a lifeless piece of boring that refused to end and made me feel used as a human being when the end did finally comebr br my advice dont watch this movie unless you have to and then only under the influence of some serious holiday eggnog
