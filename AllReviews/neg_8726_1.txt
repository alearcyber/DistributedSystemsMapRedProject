NEG i looked forward to watching this film since i loved the david lynch version in my first attempt at watching it i fell asleep nothing was happening the next night i tried to watch the rest and again it was putting me to sleep nothing ever happened in this movie that could keep anyones interest alive the only time it got a bit more exciting was when i tried it on fast forward the dvd came with a second disk which contained bonus material needless to say i had no hard to go through the torture of watching more of dune  here are the low points the acting was bad the plot moved in slow motion the sets were and looked cheap the direction was pathetic and the cgi visual effects childishbr br if you want to watch dune save your money or rent the  version
