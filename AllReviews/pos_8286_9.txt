POS the chipmunk adventure is one of the greatest animated movies of the s alvin and the chipmunks have always been of some interest to me since they were what really got me into rock and roll neither one of the chipmunks has any bad traits alvins really the star and has all the cool looks theodore is the lovable sensitive one then theres simon my personal favorite the smart one who is often a party pooper i also like the chipettes a lot theres brittany who like alvin is one who is always trying to be so popular then theres eleanor who like theodore is sweet sensitive and loves food janette is the only chipette who is not much like her counterpart shes very naive and really clumsybr br in the chipmunks very first fulllength movie david seville is going on a business trip to europe and hes leaving the boys with miss miller while hes gone while playing an arcade game alvin loses against brittany and then says that if he had the money hed race brittany around the world for real unbeknownest to the kids a man named klaus furschtien and his sister claudia who have been trying to come up with a sneaky way to deliver diamonds around the world in exchange for cash overheard this conversation and said that theyd let them race around the world for  alvin and brittany accept it and go on the racebr br this adventurous movie has a lot of great songs off to see the world made for an appropriate theme song for the movie then there is getting lucky one of my favorite songs in the movie my mother is most likely the sappiest song in the movie but it always makes me cry wooly bully is the only cover song used in the movie the rest were completely original then of course theres the boys and girls of rock and roll which in my opinion has to be one of the greatest musical numbers in movie historybr br i used to watch this movie very often until my recorded tape of it died i still watch the movie though this is actually a fun movie for people who are about to go on a vacation to a foreign country for the first time itll give you an idea of what kind of stuff youd expect out of world travel definitely one of my childhood movies and one that id recommend to s fans and alvin  the chipmunks fans
