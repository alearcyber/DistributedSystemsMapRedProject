NEG there is nothing good to say about this movie read revolution for the hell of it or any of his other writings abbie was often dismissed as the clownprince of the s but he was a man of ideas who used his cleverness his sense of humor and pop culture and his flamboyant personality to get attention to his ideas the media too often concentrated on the man not the ideas and thats the problem with this movie too later in his life he did suffer from depression but this flick is like a national enquirer version of abbie he deserves better if you dont know abbie or his times this movie wont helpbr br  this film lies i give it a zero br br
