POS soderbergh is a fabulous director but nothing he could conjure could beat the amazing cast he gathered for this zenith of sequels clearly he knew this from the getgo the term starvehicle has traditionally been used to refer to a movie that builds itself around one star what this film does is net a whole herd of hollywood hot shots and make them shine even brighter than before the last scene says it allall the stars sitting around with nothing happening and nothing being said we just get to see them socialize as though it were a scene from a reality show where george clooney catherine zetajones matt damon brad pitt and don cheadle are just hanging out being themselves so the storys not important at allat least thats not where the films greatest pleasures come from if you want a clever heist movie better stick with  but if stargazing turns you on this will make your day
