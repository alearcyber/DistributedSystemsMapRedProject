NEG pretentious horror film that looks like a soap opera gone goth about a drug that send you to a fantasy world where strange creatures lurk the film has some good imagery but its odd mix of whats real and whats not doesnt go anywhere worse are the vague pronouncements in voice over from one of the characters it seems to herald a more serious more meaningful film but i dont think they even got into the serious or meaningful territory to begin with so trying to over sell the meaning comes off silly there isnt a great deal to say people talk take drugs have visionsthey talks some more its not bad so much as pointless and dull the dull is the sin here and the reason youll want to avoid this
