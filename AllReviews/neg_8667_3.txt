NEG for a teenager who has never read austen this adaptation might be fine but only for them this is a disjointed cliff notes version of mansfield park and if you have not seen another version or read the books parts of it would be head scratchingbr br why has it been so hard to do a good adaptation of this book the one in the s took such liberties that it barely seemed to be the same book  the mindset was completely modern and prurientbr br here we have billie piper who looks like a pretty country wench she has a charming personality that develops nicely  but she has flagrantly died blonde hair with black eyebrows and  through much of the pic  dark brown roots so much for unspoiled cousin it is incredibly distracting and the rest of the cast is in the greasy hair rumpled clothing genre that shows a real disrespect for period accuracybr br one thing is good here  haley atwell is the best mary crawford of all the versions she is note perfect flirtatious without being at all modern or suggestive flippant and completely without any moral or ethical compass henry here is actually good looking enough to be a slight temptation for our heroinebr br jemma redgrave takes one of the most interesting roles in the story and manages to make her actually boring until her last scene  much too sensible this is just a production that really missed the mark a real low for austen fansbr br the only serviceable version is the one with odd duck perfect for the role sylvestra la touzel despite the very very gay henry crawford  hes just laughable
