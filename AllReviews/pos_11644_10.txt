POS i saw this movie many years ago and it has never left my list of alltime best films ever made when i first watched it i was just beginning what has become a lifelong passion for justice it gave an interesting perspective of the death penalty and also gave me a few things to think aboutbr br when you have a cast like this one you are right to assume it is going to be nothing short of fabulous this is by far the best role i have ever seen sean penn play along with i am sam he nails the role doesnt glamourize his actions while doing so he manages to maintain a level of debauchery throughout the movie that i think was very important up until the very end he does not try to be seen as anything more than what he is he is a sick man who regrets his past but still makes excuses for it he ends up able to redeem his sense of selfworth as much as a convicted and guilty murderer can through the aid of susan sarandons character sister helen prejean her character taught me about good will towards others without making me forget how horrible a persons actions can be and without making excuses for thembr br the supporting cast was also topnotch i was surprised to see a small cameo of jack black in this film given the funnyman he has become today i loved this movie for both personal reasons and just because it was a work of cinematic art and in my opinion this is one of the rare exceptions when the movie far outdid the book
