NEG okay you hippies are probably wondering what i have against an education and informative show like barney well i have a lot of hate against it for these reasonsbr br  it teaches that having a personality and individualism is immoral no one on the show has a personality everyone dresses alike talks alike acts alike and dances alike even in the episode called being an individual kids try to tell barney about what they like and everyone on the planet should do what i like do you wanna teach your kid that being an individual is wrongbr br  a stranger is a friendyou havent met episode while seemingly harmless the shows producers soonfound that it could also be extremely dangerous for young children in fact several young barneylovers from across the us fell victim to pedophiles who were using the shows friendly message to lure children away from their parents the episode has since been pulled but the damage had been done so called innocent mistakes in programming like this one clearly show why parents need to watch television with their childrenbr br  if your not happy all the time you are a bad person no one seems to show any other emotion but happiness no matter which situation they are in if the childs parents get mad or sad for some reason the child may think of mommy or daddy differently not a good message at allbr br  magic solves everything seems like every problem is solved by magic at least in shows like fraggle rock it teaches us that magic can backfire at it is best to solve problems on your own does barney teach this no of course not there has to be magic in there and the problem is a lot of two year olds cannot tell fantasy from reality and might think their parents siblings or relatives can use magic to solve everything yet become confused when they cannot use magic and think they are weird another boner pulled againbr br  barney makes no distinction between stealing and sharing he has even specifically said that stealing is okay if the person you steal from doesnt mind kids can learn that if you really want something stealing is a perfectly acceptable way to get it this is not something that preschoolers need authority figures to tell thembr br  if i just have the right thing i can solve all my problems whenever the kids have a problem barney gives them whatever they need to solve it the message being sent here is dont try to think to solve this its too much work and the solution probably wouldnt work anyway just use this because of this children could stop thinking through things barney said it was too much work and become dependent on the right object the right shoes the right food the right computer the right exercise machine this is obviously a good message for the barney marketers but its not good for preschoolersbr br  the message that cheating is okay in another episode the children are involved in a contest to carry a peanut on a spoon without dropping it one child puts peanut butter on his spoon and easily wins the child is then rewarded for his creative thinking when the child in fact bent the rules and changed the game so that he could win this teaches that cheating is good you win and people think that you are creative when in real life you will often be disqualified or worse and severely disliked by other competitors who played by the rulesbr br  do the kids in this show eat anything else besides cakes cookies and candy that teaches that it is okay to eat tons of junk food and avoid healthy food despite barneys so called health food song other than that everyone in the show eats junk food no wonder there are so many obese kids in america and europebr br and finallybr br most other kids television shows teach creative problem solving well without having to resort to magic barney could also have done that but instead decided to use the method that was a best for the marketers and b took the least time and money for scripts its a blatant sellout that shows just how little the lyons group actually cares about childrenbr br that is my rant for you all
