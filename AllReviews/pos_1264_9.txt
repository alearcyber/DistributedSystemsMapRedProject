POS saw this at the hong kong international film festival over three years ago i went in with no expectations since christopher nolan was a noname at the time but it sounded interesting and turned out to be one of the best things i saw at that festival it worked well on the big screen with the technique of cutting the scenes out of sequence adding to the mood mrnolan gave a good account of its making at the end enough to put anybody off starting out as a filmmaker i liked it better than memento although this was perhaps due to the lower expectations and the fact that it was more of an art house movie
