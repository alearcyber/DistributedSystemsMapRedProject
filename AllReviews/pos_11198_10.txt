POS the only complaint i heard about this film was that it was slow though perhaps this is the point the two characters clash unforgivingly and the slow buildup of tension between them is anxietyproducing the intricate and subtle gestures and minimal dialog take the tension to a point where an otherwise normal argument shocks the audience istanbul and the outskirts are dreamy scenery captivating and the plot is thrilling  not in that look the hero blew up yet another car and hes now flying with his motorcycle kind of way though i had chills down my spine as the characters moved in and out of each others spheres and watched the fog engulf istanbul
