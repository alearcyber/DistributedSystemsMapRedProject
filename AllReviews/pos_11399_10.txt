POS one of the things that i like about pt anderson is that he has the guts to take talent that most people push to the side or have pushed to the side and makes them stars case in point a washedup burt reynolds delivers a great performance in this film and if proving adam sander can be a great actor punch drunk love wasnt enough here comes mark whalburg like youve never seen beforebr br i think many people pass up boogie nights cause they are antiporn or just flat out hate the adult industry and cant overlook that aspect of this film but underneath that is a great story about characters losing everything and battle to regain themselves there is a beautiful film and its too bad that enough people see that
