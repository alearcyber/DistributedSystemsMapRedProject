NEG i was excited to see this show when i started seeing the promos on ae ive been fascinated with ghosts and the paranormal since i was a kid and love catching ghost hunters when its on scifi channel ive tried to watch three episodes of paranormal state and only use up my time commenting on it because its so bad and perpetuates the notion that anyone who believes in the paranormal is a gullible freak paranormal state is beyond cheesy cheesy directors log voiceovers that will leave you wishing for captain kirk cheesy teasers going into commercial breaks that are taken completely out of context everything paranormal on this show is automatically assumed to be evil and the work of a demonic spirit then come the exorcists demonologists psychics  like in poltergeist you almost expect the team to leave and say this house is clear i very much appreciate the ghost hunters approach where they go in to disprove claims then take away what they can  and they are almost always reassuring to the client if they find anything that haunted does not equal evil paranormal state is not so bad its good  its just plain bad didnt ae used to stand for arts  entertainment the art part has long been gone and the entertainment factor is now waning as well
