NEG im a big fan of the vacation franchise and i love randy quaid as cousin eddie and at least a couple of the behindthescenes names were involved in this project most notably matty simmons who produced or executiveproduced all  of the theatrical releases as well as animal house for those reasons i figured this madefortv spin off might be worth checking out even without chevy chasebr br for the record i did not expect it to be very good i just thought it might be a slightly amusing diversion therefore my high level of disappointment goes to prove just how bad this utter turd of a movie really was it was mindnumbingly jawdroppingly heartstoppingly headexplodingly terrible yet somehow i could not stop watching it its a sickness i have i cant seem to walk out on a film or give up on a tv show before it ends nothing has ever made me want two hours of my life back more than this movie
