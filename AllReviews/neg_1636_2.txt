NEG there are plenty of reviews that describe this movie as the worst ever made for sure there are plenty of mistakes lackluster acting rather boring and cliched and at times paradoxical script and the stock bmovie sound and special effects as noted there are plenty of glosses of plot making cave dwellers a tissue of fantasy film especially in comparison with the lord of the rings trilogy however this movie is not the worst movie ever most if not all including this review of these reviews are written by fans of mstk therefore many of these reviews are pretty much summaries of the mstk episode of cave dwellersbr br in the episode joel tom servo and crow remark to the mad scientists that this is the worst movie ever sent to them of course loyal fans have taken this quote and ran with it i have found this movie endearingnot in a way that one finds forrest gump endearingbut in the effort put into this movie by some the cast also this movie is laughable without its mstk treatment that is because cave dwellers does not take itself seriously and it is not trying to import into its viewers some sort of righteous theme for all of the monster puppets medieval hang gliding and continuity lapsesthis movie does not advertise to be any more that what it is a shallow depiction of a rather shallow genrebr br likewise i cant bring myself to hate miles okeeffe or lisa foster instead this hatred is for coleman francis tony cardoza jennifer lopez arch hall jr and so onbr br
