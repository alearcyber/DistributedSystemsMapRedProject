NEG first of all even imdb is slacking with this movie as the list of cast is very gappy even main characters are missing from it like buddy for examplebr br now back to the movie i love watching movies but this one tortured me throughout the whole  or however many minutes it was horrid probably the worst movie i have ever seen and the reason why it bothers me so much is because i was quite excited about seeing it beforehandbr br the plot line itself is good it could have been a great film if done properly and with careful casting golden brooks was a huge disappointment i now see that the only role she can be good in is the loud funloving energetic sexy chick she plays on girlfriends melodramatic roles are not for her at all she basically killed her character rachelbr br i love some of the cast like deborah cox mel jackson and darrin dewitt henson but even they couldnt save this catastrophic movie of course it is only my personal opinion that i can not stand hill harper as a man and he didnt help me get to like him more here eitherbr br golden brooks voice bothered me so much that i actually had to force myself to finish watching the movie it seemed like she whispered throughout the whole joint the director i wont even waste boardspace on he did such a bad job the editing photographycamera focus and just about everything about this movie was sad not to mention the dialogs absolutely unreal and many times straight hilarious when it was supposed to make you cry and search deep within yourself br br as i said it could have been a very nice movie but it was seriously messed up i would not recommend it to anyone unless they are cinematography major and want to see a what not to do example for their future workbr br have a great day everyone
