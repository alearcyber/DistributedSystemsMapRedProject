NEG moscow zero stole my money and i want it back this is a horror movie not thriller not suspense a horror movie yes this movie is a horror horrifyingly bad after many years of lurking here at imdb i am actually moved to set up an account just so i like at least one other reviewer here can warn people do not watch this movie it will steal your soul or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies this bad or at least an hour and a half of your life if you are not wise enough to hit the fast forward buttonbr br seriously id love to hear the directors voice over on an enhanced dvd theres another horrifying thought to see what the hell they were thinking the producers had to assume there were enough suckers out there to fall for the val kilmer name to make this film at least break even in international distributionbr br i actually had the misfortune to pick this to watch on movies on demand which provided no subtitles to the russian dialog not that it mattered much straining to hear the russian translate it in your head if you can only to find out how dull it is just adds insult to injurybr br i will give this movie a  because i cannot give it a lower rating and because it did achieve one remarkable thing it somehow made an almost entirely subterranean movie not feel claustrophobic now thats a dubious achievementbr br heres your spoiler and the ending holy mother no pun intended its like they ran out of money and just decided to stop filming the climax of the film literally happens seconds before the end and is solved by the simplest escape i have ever seen on film exercise your simple escape mechanism too if you find yourself watching this  the off button
