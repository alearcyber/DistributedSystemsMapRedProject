POS back in the day is an interesting but flawed effort ja rule stars as reggie cooper a honest but sad man trying to cope with the death of his father he meets his old friend jbone ving rhames who tries to force reggie into a life of crime reggie also falls in love with alica tatyana ali who is the preachers daughter now he has to choose love or crimebr br ja rule does a competent job as reggie at least hes trying to act ving rhames is perfect as jbone he brings a lot of energy and menace into the role joe morton as the preacher is his usual excellent self but he doesnt do much the same problem for giancarlo esposito as reggies dad he needed more screen time i dont want to say this but pam grier is pretty awful as mrs cooper she overacts every scene and brings the movie down tia carrere and frank langella are in it but dont do anything substantial for the plotbr br in the end you should see it for the skilled performances of ving rhames and joe morton and the grittiness of the writing and directing
