POS while i cant say whether or not larry hama ever saw any of the old cartoons i would think that writing said cartoons file cards and some of the comics would count for somethingbr br for fans of the old cartoon this is pretty much a continuation of the same except with a few new characters  and a more insane cobra commanderbr br we still have all the old favorites too but on a personal note one thing that always irritated me was this duke in charge stuff when there are tons of other officers around insteadbr br the battle sequences are similar to the old series as well the main trick here seems to be the cgi its overall pretty good if not a little overthetop
