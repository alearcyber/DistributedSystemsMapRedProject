POS this film moved me at age  in the same way that all the footage and coverage of dogtown affected me when i was  for all of those who criticized the self promotion of the z boys interviewed they have the last laugh on you that was their whole deal were better than all of you and heres whyinsert footage of the smoothest pool carve imaginable this was a film to tell their story and that was their story whether you like it or not it was their opinion of their skating that mattered not yours or mine i thought the film captured their attitude and influence exactly as i remembered it in the s the reality is that they did revolutionize skateboarding they were the impetus behind extreme sports and they did inject a cultural paradigm that reached into every corner of americana this movie gave rebirth to images of bertleman on a wave and alva and jay adams ripping up the coping that was the california dream to an entire culture of young american teenagers that just wanted to have fun and get rad as i watched this film i realized that it was these images that i lived with every day until i was old enough to move out and back down to so cal after my family had moved to nor cal when i was five until i could get back my buddies and i built and thrashed ramp after ramp searched for every empty pool possible and mimicked everything stecyk covered about these guys we are all educated and have familys and careers now but this film reminds me who i was at that age and why i still surf this is an inspired film that anyone who has an interest in pop culture extreme sports the s or even just good documentary film making will enjoy completely whenever it comes on cable i cant change the channel kudos to stacy peralta for making a beautiful piece of art
