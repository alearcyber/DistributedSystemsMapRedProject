NEG i reveal two twists at the end of the film do not read if you want to watch this movie for some reasonbr br oh my this is bad and for some reason sean bean one of the greatest present day actors has sold his soul and appears in it the only consolation is that the scriptwriters must have realised that someone as ultimately pathetic as steve guttenberg could never in his life aspire to kill someone as cool as sean bean instead he is killed in what must have seemed like a marvellous twist at the end by the good guy who was meant to be be killed by bean but was actually his boss and faked his own death dont worry i havent ruined anything for you the acting itself is spectacularly apalling with guttenbergs patented heylookicanpullachucknorrisface hard man stare dominating most of the two hours of hell on earth added to a plot that i could have written whilst being tortured and hung upside down with both hands cut off there is also a completely nonsensical critical error in the fact that one moment the virus will escape if they so much as look at it wrong while another moment steve guttenberg is bravely running around with it throwing catching bashing and generally abusing this virus which has the distinct look of a collection of those little balls of soap you put in your bath my final word if you are suicidally depressed and feel like you want to laugh manically at something that should be a bad comedy but even worse isnt tape it next time its on channel  at midnight then burn it when you realise that i am indeed telling the truth
