POS this is the ultimate of horror movies this year house of wax is one of the scariest movies ive ever seen this version really puts the vincent price version of the movie to shame i only know a few of the young cast in the movie the ever troublesome paris hilton the pain in the you know what seems to be more seductive than ever at least she didnt try to copy her infamy well if she likes to do horror shes better than wheel of fortunes vanna white she beats vanna hands down and the scene of where house of wax was made was no joke the house was made of wax and the victims were able to get out of there before the get waxed like their friends those two twins bo and vincentthe deformed twins were maniacs from the getgo the parents raised them well except for vincent and i think they became equally warped how come the the one in the other pickup happen to be creepy but not as bad as the other two thats another story in the book i guess he had to follow his heart and not the other twins who turned ambrose into a tourist trap for unsuspecting victims this movie is like the phantom of the opera meets the rocky horror picture show and this movie is one of the scariest one in  rating  out of  stars
