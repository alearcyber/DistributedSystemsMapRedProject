POS i grew up with the abbott and costello movies a because my dad grew up with them and both our last names are abbott so we owe the deo a bit of respect i didnt realize the flack this movie and others of theres gets it was a really clasic due it was funny cause abbott and costello were always the same characters but it was sooo funny now what i like about jack and the beanstalk is that even though the love story is totally boring and that one song the prince sings omg  awefull but i like the angle they took on the love story the couple has to get married cause one kingdom is running out of money they meet in the jail cell and fall in love becaue they both pretend not to be royal and they end up being the couple so happy ending i dont think that was the orginal version if it was they should have cut it out of this movie but i think it was orginal and i love it but watching it sucks lol also when the movie really kicks in with the giant  abbott and costello it is sooooo funny when the giant is beating jack into the door and jack is screaming open the door open the door that stuff is really funny and that once joke where jack starts screaming prince prince and all those dogs jump him kinda cheezy but really orginal i wish they would have al least tried to remaster it though i got that africa screamsjack and the beanstalk and i dont mind the quality cause when i had it on tape it was bad quality also so whatever i guess the begining is mildly funny the middle is really really funny and the end is not funny in the least but i am  years old and when a movie made in  makes me laugh this hard it rocks this movie is really funny i love their style also the chapters suck also the part where jack is climbing the beanstalk and they are all singing a song about what a dipstick jack is and that he will be killed thats pretty funny
