NEG i will give it a second chance but was very disappointed in the first one it wouldnt hold a candle to the other series it has a lot of meaningless dialog that doesnt add to the storyline at all i agree with the others that it doesnt seem to develop a story that is interesting it is slow and plodding and i only know what the comanches are planning to do maybe it will all tie together in the second installment but i am going to have to force myself to watch it and find out i am of apache heritage from the texasnew mexico area but i dont recognize much of what is happening maybe i am just ignorant of the facts but this isnt doing much to educate me
