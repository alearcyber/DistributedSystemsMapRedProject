NEG i was so excited to finally watch pulse after receiving it from amazon and i have to say i was utterly disappointed i perhaps think i was too hyped up i had expectations set by its fans that simply couldnt be met after loving other asian horrors i thought i knew this would find a place in my heartbr br the story was slow painfully so i am a diverse fan of horror i love the brutal bloody craziness of the devils rejects and i love equally the steady growing macabre of a tale of two sisters pulse offered little from either spectrum sadlybr br along with the sluggishness of the plot it was also very muddled i hadnt a clue why characters were doing what they were doing and how what they were doing would help their problem it seemed as if the director spouted off the plot in a sentence or two and the rest was improf from our actors unlike a tale of two sisters which also has a rather hardtofollow plot line pulse clears up very little at the end and left me feeling frustrated confused and uninterested in the characters endeavors my closing statement about the plot was its inconsistency at first it seemed as if the story was about the ghost world overflowing and their medium of escaping is the internet thats a damn original idea i like that but as the plot drones on plotholes and unexplained happenings rearing their heads in it seems the director switched to some apocalyptic tale as evident by the ending that just hasnt been clear enough throughout to executebr br i realize the dreariness of the shots and the setting was intentional to make the viewer feel bleak and isolated but the dullness of the movie was only intensified by the grainy shadowy surroundings i will admit there was a certain feel of surrealism with the movie but that may have just been my attention waning in and outbr br the actions of some of the characters are a little bit ridiculous as well and perhaps if i was more enthralled by the story i wouldve been able to suspend more disbelief but as well myself being unmotivated so too were some of the characters like i mentioned previously the logic behind what certain characters did were absent and contributed to the incoherence of the plot perhaps it was a result of the plots incoherence that the characters do questionable things to be honest i dont really carebr br the acting was decent certainly nothing outstanding but nothing terrible either no outliers to mention on either side of brilliant or plain awfulbr br now ill stop sounding so sour and mention that there were a handful of creepy moments one towards the end especially that if there were more like it throughout i wouldve enjoyed this movie almost wholly i thought whenever the website was shown it was pretty unsettling as well as some of the ghostly encounters our two main characters face the things that went on between these ghastly runins were just too lackluster baffling and wtf for me to truly appreciatebr br now for something pertaining to the dvd itself magnolias release of pulse comes with subtitles yes but the subtitles are off they arent said at the correct time of the characters speech it may sound nitpicking but it bothered me a little and it may bother some others i think this is the only north american release of the film though so you either have to deal or watch dubbing never watch dubbing i tried to like the film i really did i wanted this film to live up to the hype but sadly it fell flat for me if youre looking for other creepy asian cinema i can recommend you audition shutter a tale of two sisters strange circus and marebito  all of which are more my palette
