POS the only print of chikamatus monogatari ive been able to find was abysmal  i almost couldnt watch it which is a shame as this is among the greatest mizoguchi films the story  which i believe had been done before and since by other japanese directors  is a bit straighter than my favorite mizoguchi films sansho the bailiff and ugetsu monogatari and is essentially a tale of tragic romance in this case a transgressive romance that crosses strict class boundaries as always with mizoguchi there is an exquisitely expressed tone of defiance and  bad print aside  i was very pleased as with all of mizoguchis films im eagerly awaiting a restored dvd release  whenever that may come
