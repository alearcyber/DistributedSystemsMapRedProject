NEG im not sure who should be blamed for this debacle  in truth the acting isnt too bad and the story isnt as terrible as some madefordisney movies have been the story itself is shallow and undeveloped but that isnt surprising in a film of this type the acting is more than a bit twodimensional but i give the actors credit for managing to do anything with the material that they had to work withbr br however its inexcusable in my book to base an entire storyline on the theory that theyve created a perfect pop star and then cast an actress who cant sing to save her life if the girl cant sing have someone who can record the musicbr br this actress is a terrible singer  she was so flat she was usually singing in a totally different key
