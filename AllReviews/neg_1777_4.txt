NEG stinger starts  months ago on the submarine the ss newark where genetic experiments have gone awry  the crew member are brutally slaughtered by large killer scorpions jump to camp pendleton a couple of months later where general ashford james cagnard briefs lieutenant williams john miranda on his mission to board the newark  assist genetic scientist dr carly ryan michelle meadows before anyone knows it a group of corporate scientists  marines are onboard the newark  are shocked to discover he mutilated corpses of the crew apart from dr mike thompson casey clark who doesnt make much sense its not long before the scorpions attack first to fall is lt williams so sergeant sam harmon christopher persson is promoted  takes the responsibility to get everyone to safety  end the menace of the giant scorpions foreverbr br this sweedish america coproduction was directed by martin munthe  he also handled the cinematography  i thought this was a strictly bythenumbers uninspiring creature feature its early into the new year  stinger is the first giant genetically mutated monstercreatureinsect type film ive seen in  hopefully things can only get better the script by mat nastos is incredibly clichd  gets all of its ideas from other films most notably aliens  lets see theres the isolated location in this case being a submarine theres the hastily assembled team of marines including one who chews on a cigar throughout the entire film theres the scientists including a blonde sweedish one to try  explain it all  the evil money grabbing corporate villain who puts the mighty dollar above human life  the final ingredient being the monsteralieninsect or whatever in this case theres loads of large scorpions running around but theyre not utilised in any sort of unique or imaginative way so they might as well have been killer grasshoppers yeah its all here unfortunately stinger isnt an aliens if you get what i mean its a touch long at over  minutes  its throughly predictable although it moves along at a reasonable pace  as a dumb creature feature you could do worse despite what many say on the imdbbr br director munthe doesnt distinguish himself its not scary theres a lack of atmosphere  the action scenes are dull  unexciting theres not many scorpion attacks  its almost an hour before any significant action occurs the special effects are at the bottom end of the scale but i have seen worse thats for sure i mean thats not to say the effects in stinger are good but ive seen worse there isnt much blood or gore theres some mutilated bodies some decapitated heads  someone is ripped in half the only clever  amusing moment in the entire film is when the naked sweedish female scientist asks her lover to turn her on by talking about all the money their going to make from the scorpions however there was a moment which had me groaning  tearing my hair out in its stupidity as a bloke tries to repair the submarines circuitry  get the lights working by hitting the power supplycomputer boards with a hammer  it works as wellbr br technically stinger is average at best  theres the usual endless amount of dark corridors which gets monotonous stinger was shot in stockholm in sweeden if your interested the acting was poor  theres nothing else to saybr br stinger isnt a great film  it isnt a great horror film either i cant recommend it at all but ive seen worse if you liked stinger unlikely you might like the similarly themed giant scorpions on the loose films tail sting  or scorpius gigantus  just as unlikely
