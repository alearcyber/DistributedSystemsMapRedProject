NEG this movie was not very good in my opinion while not a complete waste of an hour and a half luckily i didnt have to pay  for it it just wasnt very scary there were parts where i jumped and a few minimally violentgory scenes but overall only someone easily frightened would consider this movie scarybr br the overall writing and acting were very weak the characters never evolved or grew as people even at the end the lead guy whatever his name was didnt man up and had to be rescued from the fire at the last minute the plot also had inconsistencies the police officer who was killed was not murdered in the same way he died in the game the girl october mentioned that in order to kill the evil demon lady you had to read something from the correct text funny how they never bothered to do that and still managed to escape the malcolminthemiddle kid died in the game but didnt die in real life also making the game play by itself was very weak writing it would have been okay for the brothers death just to get them playing again but you are supposed to play a video game and stay alive and  people die before you play againwhy do you even need the game if you like movies like the ring and thing its scary and fun watch this movie if you know someone like that you can watch it with at laugh at do it if you like horror movies that make you laugh out loud and you have the opportunity to watch this movie for free do it otherwise stay far far away
