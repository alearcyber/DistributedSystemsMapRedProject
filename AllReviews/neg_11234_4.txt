NEG a lot of the films ive made probably could have worked just as well  years ago and thats just because i have a lot of oldfashion values  steven spielbergbr br some pointsbr br  though this film is a loose remake of a guy named joe it also borrows heavily from a matter of life and death and wings of desirebr br  this was spielbergs second attempt at being frank capra br br  spielberg has often said that he wishes to make a frank capra movie in the vein of its a wonderful life and mrs smith goes to washington judging from his recent attempts to get a harvey remake off the ground it seems as though spielberg still holds this dream the director rightfully not satisfied with his last  ventures into capracornbr br  critics at the time bashed always stating that the elaborate action sequences distracted from the films romance but thats really not the problem at all the problem is that always needs a lot more special effects to distract us from the fact that spielberg cant film any line of dialogue that doesnt end in an exclamation pointbr br  the film is filled with comedy that just doesnt work spielbergs comedic tastes arent very sophisticated and seem to be ripped right out of s screwballs and looney tune cartoons these exaggerated antics may work in a cartoon universe but in a film it just seems like an odd marriagebr br  the films lead couple come across as brother and sister not lovers spielbergs films have always being apprehensive toward sex and intimacy but this film goes to extreme lengths shes a wisecracking tomboy and hes a wisecracking old man theyre more irritating than endearingbr br  the film contains one good scene in which john goodman argues with holly hunter but for the most part the films characters are too annoying theres no subtlety every emotion overplayed every joke over designed every sequence filled with unnecessary busynessbr br  always and hook taught spielberg how to con audiences after their failure and the twin financial failures of the color purple and empire of the sun spielberg dumped the goofy colour cinematography of color purple and empire of the sun in favour for the more desaturated black and white worlds of schindlers list munich minority report and saving private ryan from here on less light and dark cinematography became equated with serious topicsbr br  after the financial success of each dark film spielberg reverts back to his colour cinematography and falls flat on his face once again amistad followed schindlers list ai followed ryan and lincoln will follow munich these colour films are always bashed for being too tacky sentimental corny and hokey but the truth is if you removed the desaturation all these serious films would feel the same waybr br  since the s spielberg has tried to differentiate himself from the other brat pack directors scorsese de palma coppola etc by pretending to be an optimist and humanist he would himself state this repeatedly during many interviews in the late s the reality though is that he is probably the biggest sadist of all these directors the very form of his films often undermining their content their very box office performances always proportionate to their dazzling displays of carnage br br  the failure of spielberg to connect with any of the characters in always and the relish he shows instead for filming forest fires airplanes crashing etc perfectly encapsulates the rest of his filmography people running from dinosaurs sharks nazis tripods rocks etcthis is what spielberg delights in the moment his characters stop to speak however everything selfdestructs a film like amistad failed in other words because not enough blacks died and too many whites talkedbr br  the films flying scenes arent up to the standards set several years earlier in the megahit top gun of course when your enemy is a forest fire its hard to make things cinematicbr br  failures like  hook always etc are often more illuminating that spielbergs more successful films they reveal the steel skeleton beneath the technique they show what the amusement park ride looks like when its not working revealing the vacuum beneath the broken machinerybr br   theres one good sequence here two actors in a room simply improvising but this is mostly an annoying picture with a predictable scriptbr br worth one viewing
