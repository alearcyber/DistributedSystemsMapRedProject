NEG history teacher mrs tingle seems to have it in for student leigh ann watson who has her heart on achieving a writing school scholarship she receives another low grade from tingle which doesnt help when one of her classmates luke steals the paper of the final history exams and pops it in her bag mrs tingle finds it sticking out she threatens the three that she will go to the principal about it but hes not available so before she reports it the next morning leigh her friend jo lynn and scott head to her place that night and try to convince her not tell the principal however due to tingles stubbornness that find themselves reverting to drastic measures to stop this getting outbr br wasnt fan of it when i first saw it and after another viewing im still not one writer kevin williamson was on a roll after penning the successful contemporary teen horror films scream  i know what you did last summer  scream   and the faculty  he was riding the success also not to forget the tv show dawsons creek but this project would be the final bump the difference there compared with this entry was other then writing the screenplay he was also making his debut in directing the strange thing though was that i found his direction to be competently done but material he stormed up to flavourless and tired it seemed to get caught in playing both a black comedy and straightout thriller without making it gel the script is cluttered with quickwit ongoing gags trivial stretches and gimmicky references towards other films but the problem is that its too watereddown with so many contrived developments and sappy moral currents disrupting the flow the fractured script had to be more strong and potent since its a smallscale production that feels like youre watching a stage show because of its mostly confined sets it tries to play mind games with the characters but these moments are there to only serve the storys poor progression into a puddle of stupidity and senselessness the films ending takes the cake williamsons polished direction is sound but more so in a pedestrian way and therefore it lacks suspense and the pacing even with its taut surroundings can really plod on you eventually feel it after the halfway mark and it shows up how minor the story is the performances are tolerable enough although if it werent for helen mirrens classy icy portrayal of manipulative prowess as mrs tingle and a buoyant marisa coughlan we would have been stuck watching a vapid goodytoshoes katie holmes barry watson is modest in his slacker part and molly ringwald has a lesser role the soundtrack packs enough energy but i found it terribly overwrought and shapeless in its choicesbr br watchable but mechanical all round
