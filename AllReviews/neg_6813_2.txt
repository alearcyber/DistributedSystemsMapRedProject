NEG after reading the reviews i decided to rent the dvd version br br i like classical music and wanted to learn more about bach br br i was disappointed i guess i do not know enough about bach music and the the comments were not enough for me to understand the importance or what music was being played br br maybe it would be appropriate with the guidance of an expert in bachs music that can explain the film br br i really tried and saw the whole film hopping that i would be able to enjoy at least some of it but i did not br br see it at your own risk
