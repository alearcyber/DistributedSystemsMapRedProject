POS as a canadian i didnt know very much about the whitlam dismissal i had read the wikipedia page about those events but that was about it earlier this year when canada went through a potential constitutional crisis it fizzled out thankfully that might have led to intervention by our governorgeneral the whitlam dismissal was mentioned in the press in an effort to learn more i ordered the dvd of this miniseries through ebaybr br i was greatly impressed by how interesting the account was as dramatic as events were this could have been a very boring political drama however it was a pretty suspenseful miniseries i was also impressed by how understandable it was despite my lack of familiarity with australian politics it didnt take long to figure out who everyone was and what their roles werebr br having said that it is not an entirely impartial account malcolm fraser is certainly portrayed as a rather machiavellian figure who lets no person or thing get in the way of his quest to be prime minister gough whitlam is portrayed in a more noble almost saintly light however the actor portraying whitlam channels the nobility in such a way that it comes across more as pomposity i thought that sir john kerr was portrayed in a fairly sympathetic mannerbr br i must warn people that the dvd is of very poor quality i understand that it was made for television in the early s but it would appear that no effort was made to restore the picture quality or sound quality it was very disappointing that no extras were added either a documentary or even some interviews with the historical figures would have enhanced the experience but there is nothingbr br i highly recommend this miniseries for anyone interested in the reallife events
