POS in sri lanka a country divided by religion and language the civil war between the prosinhalese government and the liberation tigers of tamil eelam ltte a separatist organization has claimed an estimated  lives since  human rights groups have said that as a result of the war more than one million people have been displaced homeless or living in camps the impact on children and families caught in the conflict is sensitively dramatized by acclaimed tamil director mani ratnam in his  film a peck on the cheek winner of several awards at the national film awards in india while the civil war is merely a backdrop for the story of a young girls voyage of discovery the human cost of war is made quite clear and ratnam gives the fighting a universal context pointing the finger at global arms traffickers as the source of wrongdoingbr br beautifully photographed in southern india by cinematographer ravi k chandran in a setting mirroring the terrain of sri lanka the film tells a moving story about an adopted year old girl who sets out to find her real mother in the middle of the fighting in sri lanka played with deep feeling and expressiveness by ps keerthana in a memorable performance amudha is brought up by a loving middle class family with two younger brothers after her natural parents shyama nandita das and dileepan jd chakravarthi were forced to flee when the fighting broke out leaving her in a red cross camp in a loving flashback we see amudhas adoptive parents father thiru madhavan a prominent tamil writer and mother indra simran a tv personality marry to facilitate their adoption of the darkerskinned little girlbr br young amudha has no idea that she is adopted until it is sprung upon her abruptly on her ninth birthday according to the parents prior agreement while she is playing thiru tells her almost in a matter of fact tone that you are not our daughter and the response is predictable distraught she questions who her father was what her mothers name was why she gave her up and so forth but few answers are forthcoming amudha runs away several times until her parents agree to go to sri lanka to help her find her true mother now a fighter for the tamil separatists the familys immersion in the reality of the civil war leads to some traumatic moments and difficult decisions handled mostly with skill by ratnam though a sequence where the family was caught in a crossfire felt amateurishbr br a peck on the cheek is of course a bollywoodstyle film and that means tons of music and melodrama the melodrama did not get in the way because of the strong performances by the lead actors however i found the musical dramatizations of songs by a r rahman counter to the mood of the film with their slick high production techniques and fastpaced music videostyle editing yet the compelling nature of the story and the honesty in which it is told transcend the films limitations tamil cinema has been criticized by many even within the country as being too clichd and commercial yet a peck on the cheek is both a film of entertainment and one that tackles serious issues that it successfully straddles the line between art and commerce is not a rejection but a tribute
