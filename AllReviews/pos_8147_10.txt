POS honestly at first i watched this movie because of the gratuitous sex scenes i heard it possesses but by actually watching the film it just made me realize that there are still good and sensible movies out there truly it is one of the most wellcrafted and touching movies ive ever watched im a teenage bisexual and the film spoke to me about my predicaments  sex religion love acceptance etc it gave me an idea on how to deal with these issues with the help of my self and others around me who love me for who i am cox really handled the movie well by sprinkling dozes of heartwarming lines and a bit of sexuality in it it made the movie more interesting some people compare it to brokeback mountain but i dont agree myself brokeback mountain has more drama while latter days is wellbalanced
