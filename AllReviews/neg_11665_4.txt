NEG this turned out to be more of a womens romancesoapsuspense film than what i hoped it wassimply a tense thriller yes the final  minutes were suspenseful but much of the previous  bordered on being just plain tediousbr br ruter hauer was a little too subdued not playing his normal intense character natasha richardson sports somewhat of a dumb look most of the time and her character was very unappealingbr br the story is soso its not as bad as im making out but it sure isnt anything id watch again and the back of the vhs describing this movie was misleading
