POS this is one of the most enjoyable teen movies i have ever seen and that i wished was released to video it was released the same year as another great comedy in which tim matheson played a role animal house which is probably why it was overlooked br br one of the most memorable parts of this film would definitely be the soundtrack which could have and should have been a formal label release the soundtrack features a lesserknown s act named high inergy whose song we are the future played a marquee role in the movies prom scene i remember purchasing the groups album steppin out as a kid mainly because of the look of the girls and not necessarily for their musical talents br br the closing song is one of the best ballads i have ever heard and i can still hear it in my head i wish i knew the groups name so that i could look for it somewhere in cyberspacebr br if you liked films such as over the edge and rich kids i think this is one that you will enjoy as well
