NEG stick around is one of the brief series of films that paired bobby ray with oliver babe hardy before hardys immortal teaming with stan laurel several critics have suggested that ray and hardy  the gormless little man and the overbearing big man  were a prototype for laurel and hardy but that simply isnt true ray and hardy play off each other well but really arent a team in each of these films ray has more footage and is clearly meant to be the hero while hardy bullies him in a manner very much unlike his later ollie characters treatment of stanley its very clear that the relationship between little bobby and big babe was inspired by earlier chaplin films in which the little tramp was bullied by huge mack swain or burly eric campbellbr br however in stick around hardy sports a bowler hat thats identical to his later ollie titfer although with a fuller moustache and he and bobby  after spending most of this movie as adversaries  end up as drunken comradesbr br bobby is a paperhanger for the firm of matz and blatz with hardy as his boss when the tardy bobby tries to pretend he showed up promptly theres some clever physical business between the two men that reminds me of a routine performed by roscoe arbuckle and buster keaton in the garage a bit later bobby ray  whose brief acting career never firmly developed a screen persona  performs an impossible gag that would have been inappropriate for stan laurel when he pulls a long stepladder out of a much smaller toolkitbr br the paperhangers go to work in a sanitarium and there are the usual unrealistic depictions of mental illness one resident insists on sitting on a piece of toast because he thinks hes a poached egg there are also some howlingly racist and tastelessly unfunny gags involving a black man who obligingly lets the inmates crack open walnuts on top of his head when he sees a picture of a lion  not even a photograph mind you  he goes all cowardly as if it were an actual wild animalbr br stick around is fairly dire most of the pantomime and acting is much broader than it needs to be for a slapstick comedy even hardy already a very subtle actor by  pongs badly with his overacting here there are several bad examples of shotmatching i was impressed with one unusual camera setup when a fat pedestrians face is dirtied and we see a closeup of his reflection in a hand mirror rather than his actual facebr br spoilers coming during their brief pairing hardy typically played rays boss or adversary or both here for once they end up as pals its a nice ending but it doesnt make up for whats really a poor film my rating for this one is only  out of
