NEG this is easily one of the worst movies ive seen in a long long time and ive recently seen starship troopers  i could find nothing to redeem this film the acting which is probably the best aspect of the film is fair at best michael madsen hams it up in his standard character persona denis hopper doesnt seem to know what hes supposed to be vinnie jones accent is bizarre one positive thing is that leonor valera looks fantastic her acting is pretty poor but i doubt thats why shes therebr br the dialogue is truly appalling it is quite simply rubbish i dont know who signed off on this but they really need to get professional help next time roundbr br this film is the reason imdbs rating system should be able to include zero stars out of ten avoid at all costs
