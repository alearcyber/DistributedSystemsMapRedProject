POS billy wilder created a somewhat conventional biopic about the charles lindberg flight he structures the film using flashbacks extensively to tell the lindberg story leading up to the famous flight across the atlantic which happens in present time in the film flying an airplane for hour after hour is not the stuff of excitement and wilder is not going to deviate from his theme of lindberg as hero of the common man so things are predictable however james stewart is well cast and quite believable as lindberg and the many obstacles he has to overcome just to get his plane in the air keep one watching br br the film comes through most successfully as wilder weaves the parts of the story together in a way that create tension then relief then tension again the cinematography is quite good score by franz waxman enhances the scenes and stewart really seems to make lindberg come alive makes one believe he could be lindberg there is a bit of s religious schmaltz at the end but overall the direction acting and high production values overcome the predictability of the story would anybody really see this picture and not know that lindberg made it across the atlantic to make an enjoyable film that has aged better than most films from that time billy wilder made films of a wide variety of types and this is one that is representative of his craftsmanlike best
