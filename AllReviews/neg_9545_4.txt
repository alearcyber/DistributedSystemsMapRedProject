NEG am i the only person who thinks that the entire forensics and scenes of crime community in the usa must detest this almighty slap in their faces a rookie cop is first to a crime scene where her back up is so slow to respond that she has time to send the kid who found the body to the local store to buy a disposable camera by the time he returns still no senior cops socos or other assistance for the lovely jolie  this is new york isnt it it has started raining and she gets to work photographing the evidence only after shed stood in front of an amtrak to stop it disturbing the scenebr br i want to know the name of that camera as the photographs were so incredibly detailed that no amount of zooming in distorted the images the horror continues not in the film itself pretty ordinary im afraid but in the lincoln rhyme character as played by mr washington this man is a highly dedicated forensic crime scene examiner with years of experience who instead of the highly trained but invisible local crime scene examiners entrusts the work to an untrained cop a rookie cop who proceeds to find the very obviously placed clues and move them before photographing them thus contaminating every item and making dna profiling well nigh impossible now that was a bright idea eh i know one should be able to suspend disbelief to a degree but those who say this film is intelligent must have entirely disengaged their ability to think in order to find this film believablebr br i have given this film  for the superb acting of denzel washington and for miss jolies lips which are the only items requiring my disbelief to be suspended
