POS yikes and we all thought joan crawford was the horror mommy dearestwell laura hope crewes as mom in this stinging  character film delivers and cops the goods in this cracker of a marital mommy manglethe silver cord is a genuinely sensational pre code drama from rko made in  released in  from a  play so astonishing frank and honest is each startling verbal exchange between one sons wife irenedunne along with the others fianc as these two younger girls together go to war  gleefully angrily unwrapping the clearly incestuous hankerings of mom towards her hunky eldest son played by virile joel maccrea and her younger beauson payed by delicate and beautiful  year old actor eric linden i would think this film played to many howling appreciative audiences in huge theaters in  and offers viewers even in  a very fruity melodrama enlivened by crackling dialog not afraid to call mother exactly as she is this film would have been impossible to make after the censorship code came in after  other viewer comments on the imdb support my reaction and you will find almost everyone lucky enough to see and tape the silver cord will agree it is an unforgettable and pungent script in a superbly produced film it would have played like the virginia wolf of  laura hope crewes must have kissed the sound stage at rko for this role of a lifetimeeven more than her fluffy turn in gwtw irene dunne is as gorgeous and casual and believable as ever fighting for her husband yet again and it is well worth seeing the divorce made in  as a companion piece to the silver cord joel macrea is certainly in the same league as cary grant and randolph scott in the handsome and lovable stakes i had never seen eric linden in a real acting role before he played the leg amputee in the hospital horror scene in gwtw and here he is startling and youthful with an excellent role as robert the younger and more sensitive son some verbal barbs leveled at him again would not get past the code office if made later this is a really good film and if the viewer forgives some of the creakiness of its time and settles in for a sparring match of unequaled pungency for a  movie you will be well rewarded at first i thought some of the throat clutching melodrama of mother was dated until i realized it was a set up of the excellent screenplay to make the viewer laugh at her as though she is a weak little old ladynot but nor are the other two women in this powerhouse play on film hence the fantastic retort dialog that oceanliner seen in reel one is the leviathan the monster ship the us won from the germans in ww that was so huge and unwieldy that crews were nervous wrecks trying to wrestle with it upon the atlantic it is infamous for ploughing headfirst up a colossal wave in a storm and shot over the crest at such an angle the spine along the bottom cracked and the ship split vertically between the funnels it limped to port with rattling steel panels and winking rivet holesand mentally shattered crew and passengers it was scuttled in  after being cursed and plagued with horror mechanical problems all its existence not such a war prize after all br br anyway the dialog in the silver cord is enough excitement for one night eg mother the doctor said there was nothing wrong with you in fact he said it would take a stick of dynamite to kill you whammo
