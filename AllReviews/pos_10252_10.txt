POS cooley high was actually a drama with moments of comedy it was a reflection of high school life back in the day i attended coolidge high in washington dc from  to  and much of what was in cooley high was an every day thing at coolidge as a matter of fact after the movie came out everybody started calling coolidge cooley high getting high shooting dice chasing girls basement parties and fights that sums up high school life for many in dc back in the day i cant forget motown because motown music began and ended many a day back in the s the hits just kept coming however cooley high adds a layer of humanity over the craziness because when all was said and done just like in cooley high my classmates and i had a lot of love for each other and like the characters in cooley high there was life after high school but there was nothing like waking up every morning and experiencing each day to the fullest from homeroom to seventh period thirty years later we are getting ready to celebrate those good times cooley high is definitely a period piece that just gets better with time because like it or not the only thing left from those days are memories some good and some bad
