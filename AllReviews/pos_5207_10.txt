POS if we compare the movie industry with an ocean we have the tendencies to observe only the surface driven by the strong hollywood marketing force we all saw war movies like saving private ryan the thin red line apocalypse now or full metal jacket but underneath the splashy waves grow in silence from time to time less known pearls when you pick one and look carefully at it you wonder why this pearl lie almost unknown and why its not already on the crownbr br stalingrad is such a gem why it has a bunch of multimillion dollars rated actors no it have thousand of extras no it have breathtaking spectacular shiny computerized visual effects not at all so whats so special well in one word its pure past reality recreated and transposed to celluloid fifty years later the tragedy of the most bloody battle in the history is here filthy wounded soldiers russian civilians who lost everything during the invasion burning villages collapsing buildings decayed suburbs gunfires explosions tanks in flames soldiers shot burned alive ground by tanks in their pits or shred to pieces  you got all but the real horror is elsewhere people are reduced to simple pawns without the power to change anything the soldiers we follow in film try to leave the combat zone and they fail the civilians stay in prostration in the middle of nowhere only crying for their children killed mercyless the huge grinding machine of war melt together humans equipment villages cities  and ask for more victims and destruction over and overbr br in all this collective insanity a group of german soldiers struggle to survive and to keep at least a minimum level of normality they do their duty and fight bravely but as everyone know a battle is almost lost when people start to loose confidence and faith we see how all those people are abandoned how they plan to desert how they struggle to catch the very last plane to berlin full of wounded how some very bad injured soldiers were treated as simulants and shot how they were forced to execute a small group of russian civilians including a young boy how they later discovered a place literally full up to the ceiling of food and drinks  destined only for some superior officers of course one by one they drop dead the end of the movie is one of the most bitter depressing and touching ending i ever saw all on the magnificent score of the munich philarmonic orchestra the war destroyed everything in its pathbr br this movie is a mustsee for everyone a true movielover should have it in hisher collection the strong antiwar message must be a warning for all of us unfortunately the mankind never learn nor the politicians selfdestruction is in our dna and the human pain seem to last forever can we be enough reasonable to stop the war
