NEG yah i know it has the name sinatra in the title so how bad can it be well its bad trust me i rented this thinking it was some movie i missed in the theaters its not its some garbage movie made by the folks at showtime cable station geez these cable stations make a few bucks they think they can make whatever garbage movies they want its not good i am as big a sinatra fan as any sane man but this movie was just dumb boring dull unfunny uninteresting the only redeeming quality is that assuming they did stick to the facts you do learn about what happened to the captors of frank jr otherwise its just a stupid film
