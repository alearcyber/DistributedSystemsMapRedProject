NEG embarassing is the only word to describe this laughingly awful production from the blatant disregard of the source material sure to infuriate anyone remotely familiar with mythology to the predictably insufficient production value this entire miniseries is a train wreckbr br the cast which includes some good actors whom i pity delivers the illogical dialogue in the same generic european accent so common to bad epics worse is the lack of originality in almost all other aspects from costume and set design blurring together styles from across time and space to the score which seems to poorly mimic many recognizable classical tunes as well as lord of the rings most offensive of all are the visual effects which single handedly prove that if you cant afford to do them well write them outbr br it pained me to see yet another legendary tale bastardized by a cheap adaptation maybe one day someone will do it right
