POS hilarious clean lighthearted and quoteworthy what else can you ask for in a film this is my alltime number one favorite movie ever since i was a little girl ive dreamed of owning a blue van with flames and an observation bubblebr br the clich characters in ridiculous situations are what make this film such great fun the wonderful comedic chemistry between stephen furst harold and andy tennant melio make up most of my favorite parts of the movie and who didnt love the hopeless awkwardness of flynch dont forget the airport antics of leons cronies dressed up as hari krishnas dancing chanting and playing the tambourineunbeatable the clues are genius the locations are classic and the plot is timelessbr br a word to the wise if you didnt watch this film when you were little it probably wont win a place in your heart today but nevertheless give it a chance you may find that it doesnt matter what you say it doesnt matter what you do youve gotta play
