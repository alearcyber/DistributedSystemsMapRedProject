POS cat in the brain is a series of extremely violent sequences knitted together by a plot that feels more like an overview describing director lucio fulcis most notorious years of filmmaking the movie could also be seen as a dark comedy of sorts effectively spoofing the various claims that violent cinema causes violence in real life fulci goes further than that he casts himself as the star the central figure of the film thus showing the audience who is the man behind all the cinematic gore cat in the brain is not about presenting a clear story and following it instead it pokes fun at some of the clichs that have been surrounding the horror genre for yearsbr br lucio fulci plays himself as a horror director struggling to keep his humanity intact years of violent film making have finally began to reach him it starts slowly steaks and meat in general begin to disgust him his colleagues assure fulci that all he needs is some rest but that doesnt help and soon the grotesque ideas for his movies begin to overwhelm his daily thoughts in an attempt to find a cure for his dangerously maddening mental state lucio starts going to the local psychiatrist unfortunately that does more wrong than good and fulci is thrown into an even bigger mess as the psychiatrist turns out to be a psychopath who mimics the murders from fulcis films in real lifebr br the film retains all the trademarks of italian splatter cinema good or bad they are all here so any comments about the acting or the technical aspects and budget constrains are quite irrelevant as to the quality of the film it is a visual experience no doubts about it fulci throws in an incredible amount of violence easily surpassing pretty much everything hes made amputated by chainsaw limbs cannibalism child murder decapitation these are just some of the many grotesque acts witnessed in cat in the brain some of them are obviously recycled from a few the directors less profile movies but they dont stand out of the context and actually feel quite at home here as i noted before the movie exists much better as a satire of the genre rather than a serious piece the way some of the violence is presented does help establish that idea such sequences shortly after climax are rejected by the reality in the film as they are revealed to be actually scenes inside a movie that fulcis character is directing this sort of film in film presentation lessens somewhat the impact of the gore but in no way does it make it an easy to watch film oh no this is far beyond and above the levels of gore found in mainstream horror and gorehounds will in no doubt be satisfied with that factbr br lucio fulci was a very polarized figure people either hate his work or love it cat in the brain wont convince any of fulcis detractors in the opposite but it is nevertheless an interesting part of his filmography one that fans should really check out
