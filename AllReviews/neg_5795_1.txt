NEG in the last few years of ron millers soninlaw of walt disney cum producer reign he churned out liveaction crap on a stick often starring the very boring dean jones whose entire career was based on that kind of light emptyheaded fare other horrible films from that same period include petes dragon the last flight of noahs ark unidentified flying oddball and the dreaded condorman ill not mention tron because i thought it ambitious and miller was only the executive producer on it so he had little to do with the actual production however he was in full force when this godawful piece of human junk was expelled from the bowels of creativity herbie goes to monte carlo second sequel to much loved love bug tale finds herbie in love with another car who has a brain and heart too theres a race some lame bad guys a diamond and barney fife shot in france the film actually is nicely photographed and the countryside is lovely but one gets the idea the film was made so all involved could have a three month vacation in france the rest of film is a wreck prat falls bumbling thieves wicked german racing competitors and a pretty bouncing feminist all fall under the category of stock supply the biggest insult of the film trying to further develop herbies lover personality via shakes beeps flashing lights and movements indicative of a horny seventeen year old disneys writers do an injustice to our cute little vw then again i would think itd be tough for anyone to top helen hayes driving herbie around a skyscraper ledge in the second outing
