POS like most sports movies its not surprising that people who know something about the sport can find flaws in it as a soccer referee i have yet to see a movie or tv show get it right when depicting a match forever has good actors but i found sean astin to be a bit young to be an administrator in a juvenile jail i was very thankful that the plot did not involve the lead character turning his fellow inmates into rugby players and taking on flagstaff as well as highland which gets to credulity a police squad car just happens to pull up at precisely the time the flagstaff baddies are hazing rick penning even though rugby is not a sanctioned high school sport nationally the team is a schoolbased club sport  much like rodeo that said i find it hard to believe that high school officials would allow students to play with open wounds that just isnt done in this day of aids and hepatitis i dont care what the tradition and macho image is despite that it was a cool movie in that teens were expected to act like adults and sometimes actually did sadly far too many coaches are like flagstaffs  or worse
