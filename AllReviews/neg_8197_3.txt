NEG this is a movie that was probably made to entertain the middle school early high school age kids maybe to them its funny they may possibly even see something scary in it to me the acting is poor and plot is poor theres just not much value at all for the adult viewer i saw this film as weak and boring at times there was the possibility that the movie could become interesting but it never really materialized the creatures look pretty good but after seeing them for a few seconds they dont seem to have any substance other than the look at times i wasnt sure if the movie was trying to make another attempt at comedy or was it just another attempt at horror that failed again this movie just wasnt good for me
