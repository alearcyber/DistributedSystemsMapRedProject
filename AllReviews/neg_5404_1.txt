NEG i have very few to add to what all the other reviewers already made more than clear this movie is awful beyond awful in fact so insufferable that they have yet to come up with a term to describe the awfulness that is skeleton man in case you expect your movies to feature a minimum of logic and plot you should stay as far away from this as humanly possible sure loads of people are getting killed by this skeletonpuppet wearing a ridiculous cape but nobody ever bothers to properly explain what he is where he comes from or why hes so angry with the world he looks like a crossover between skeletor from masters of the universe and the horseman from sleepy hollow and runs amok in some godforsaken wilderness the setting of skeleton man is another totally retarded aspect for nearly half an hour i assumed that the movie took place at a small isolated island but it simply plays at the mainland where fancy highways cross the forest and power plants are located at the end of the woods huh why does everybody pretend to be trapped when there are like a million escape routes anyway after a couple of totally random killings a special commando squad led by poor washedup michael rooker arrives to come and hunt a monster they dont know anything about really hilarious is how every member of this squad introduces himherself as the expert in a certain field we have a sniperspecialist a tracking genius a drill instructor yet they all die before any of them is able to demonstrate their supposedly masterful skills the horror gods must really hate casper van dien as hes present again as well portraying an heroic soldier who steals a truck for no apparent reason crashes on the highway but somehow gets catapulted back to the middle of the woods to die there right that makes sense furthermore the characters steal cool oneliners from predator the boneheads horse constantly changes colors helicopters are brought down with bow arrows ordinary bullets cause trees to explode and completely pointless vietnam flashbacks haunt michael rooker i say we all combine forces and vote this pathetic flick into the imdb bottom top  asap
