NEG i recently picked up all three robocop films in one box set rather cheaply and the only reason i did this was for the special edition of the superb first one i have seen robocop  before but not for  years the year it came out i have never watched it since because i can still remember how disappointed i was when i discovered how appalling it really is its a complete mess really it has all the signs of a troubled production with so many subplots going on at the same time it has a very uneven tone also and it is also one of the nastiest films i have ever seen i dont mind a little violence the first one was incredibly violent but this one is just plain nasty also the sfx is terrible even for  say hello to bad stop motion also having a drug dealing cursing kid as a villain is just a little too much peter weller at least had the common sense not to return for the next one the only positive thing i can say for this film is it does have a couple of nice gags like the thank you for not smoking one and the kiddie baseball team robbing an electrics store to quote the kid who plays the villain it sucks
