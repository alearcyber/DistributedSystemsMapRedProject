POS amazing amazing amazing what more can be said jacobi is the best hamlet ever to grace the stage and captures every inch of the character every nuance and element of hamlet is depicted and depicted well some people have complained about his age but you honestly cannot tell when watching the film if anything he looks drastically younger than  i only wish a more worthy ophelia could have been found her acting is passable but she just doesnt look the part the only real exceptional performances come from jacobi and stewart who is a great claudius the rest of the cast is good but jacobi is what truly elevates this teleplay
