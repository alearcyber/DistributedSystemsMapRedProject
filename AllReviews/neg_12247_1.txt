NEG this film would be a great piece of history if in fact it was a real film of the kennedy assassination the are far too many mistakes in this film for me to point out it is a film of the kennedy assassination but many of the important facts have been altered there are missing scenes and many of the scenes after the presidents limo passes the sign dont fit in both kennedys move noticeably slower then the other four people in front of them next time you watch this film look for things that dont add up such as the texas gov and his along with the ss men in the front lunge forward but you can see that the limo is not stopping or slowing down in fact is is accelerating this film is clearly an attempt at a cover up
