NEG although there is very little plot and whatever exists is just all improvisational still it was a good start from a new director with no previous financial back up and also a smart move from andy warhol to make his cimematic productions more marketable and viewerfriendly in any case this story of a street hustler relies too much on showing joe buck naked almost all the time and the creative use of a flashy editing really wears off after the hundredth time and the cutting off the dialog thing gets really annoying halfway this would have been a much more entertaining or even dramatic if they made a documentary of the daily of an actual male prostitute or hustler instead of letting the actors make up some nonesensical plot and dialog of their own
