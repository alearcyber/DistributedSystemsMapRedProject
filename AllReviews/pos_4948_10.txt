POS this was an awesome movie with flight scenes that were incredibly realistic i have seen it multiple times and it has kept my attention throughout every time i myself am a big fan of the air force and love to watch any movie where i can get a glimpse of an f flying if you like top gun then i guarantee you will love this movie also except for a few mild curse words this is an excellent movie for the whole family it has a great plot and does not have a dull moment throughout the entire movie every second is action packed and keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens next so once again i highly recommend this movie
