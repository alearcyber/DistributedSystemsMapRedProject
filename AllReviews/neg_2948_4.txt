NEG the movie starts off with reeve ekin and his assistant fighting same vampires this scene is probably the best out of the entire movie the rest of the movie unfortunately is cheesy highly unrealistic and a buffy the vampire slayer ripoff the ending also sucks big timebr br some moments such as the scene where gypsy and helen played by popular chinese duo band twins charlene  gillian fight over a stuffed teddy bear are particularly cringeworthy the storyline is also lame surely they could have come up with something more scary than a book called day for nightbr br some good parts though jackie chan and anthony wong make the movie bearable with their comical roles however the good bits just end there charlene  gillian from twins have never been able to act well and annoy you to pieces and the friendly but wussy vampire role was unfortunately given to edison chen who is a talentless pretty boy br br rating
