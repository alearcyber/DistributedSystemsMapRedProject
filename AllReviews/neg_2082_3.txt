NEG the greek locale for parts of the movie were very beautiful and the photography get all my votes and thats about the extent of my raves for this movie i found that all the characters were narcissistic archetypes found so often in the american culture and were shallow and uninteresting susan sarandon and gena rowlands are easy to look at but i found their characters very narcissistic and unlikeable for many other reasons when gena rowlands sings at a party it made me wonder how this woman could think of herself as a competent star of the stage i was tempted to hit the mute button until she finished singing molly ringwald was herself and raul julias character was so lecherous he was downright creepy the movie was much too long for my liking and i could not sit through it again even at the point of a gun
