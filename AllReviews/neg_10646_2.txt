NEG in the xxii century an architect by the name of merchant bruce ramsay commandeers a space station which he personally designed as can be predicted a special force is sent to retake the expensive station and put merchant into custody upon arrival they find him partaking in a weird ritual with the use of a mysterious cubical during interrogation he reveals that they must let him finish what he has started or else the hell he has released will bathe in blood in order to convince the officers holding him captive he reminisces about his heritage about the toymaker who built the box and about the reasons as to why he is here in spacebr br the movie that is essentially the same to hellraiser that the quickening was to highlander something to be ignored and forgotten as so it wont influence the lore of hellraiser to much by far the most trashy of the franchise with a much more lowgrade feel to it than its predecessors who lets face it were b or c class filmsbr br acting at times seems to be influenced by a midbudget pornflick with wooden unbelievable performances that actually have you thinking so when are they going to undress and start with the intercourse surprisingly not much sex in the movie albeit the introduction of the seductressdemon angelique a totally superfluous character that unnecessarily messes with what we know of the world of hellraiser offers ample opportunities for the lovemakingbr br basically the movie consists of three abruptly pasted together separate short stories one in the future one in the present and one in the past which lack focus and are rushed along in amateurish fashion the end result is extremely poor basically underlined by the fact you have no interest into what happens to any of the characters in the filmbr br some decent gore in the flick but apart from that an utter failure
