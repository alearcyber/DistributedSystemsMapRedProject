NEG possible spoilers br br the sixth halloween film is an utterly depressing affair but unfortunately not in the manner envisioned by the filmmakers by now everyone knows the story of how it was butchered and released in such a sloppy incoherent form the second half in particular makes little to no sense as plot elements are introduced and dropped seemingly at random the very ending left me scratching my head what the hell happened is dr loomis dead or what this is what you get when you put a shameless hack in charge of a motion picture its not a pretty sight br br on a related note this is the most graphically violent entry in the series i have no problem with gore if its in the right place but this movie takes it to absurd levels the infamous exploding head must be a new low for the series michael himself even seems to be enjoying the act of murdering another human being inconsistent with his efficient methodical approach in the john carpenter original br br im not quite sure who was responsible director joe chappelle or the producers probably a combination of both id be perfectly happy to grant a pardon to all concerned if only theyd release the legendary producers cut a more complete version of the film that is a vast improvement from every account from what i understand its like a different movie altogether i offer to pay full price to purchase the dvd if miramax comes to its senses and releases it br br there are a handful of good elements however the idea of michael being controlled by the druids is intriguing paul rudd is solid as tommy doyle whose appearance is a neat tiein with the original the slick visuals help make the proceedings a bit more watchable but these meager offerings are overshadowed by the overload of drivel we have to put up withbr br finally the curse of michael myers is noted for being donald pleasances last film many of his scenes were excluded from the final cut and when he does appear he seems frail and unhappy the movie is dedicated to his memory a blatant if unintentional insult if there was ever one the fact that a talented performer should end his career like this is too depressing to even think about br br  out of br br released by dimension films
