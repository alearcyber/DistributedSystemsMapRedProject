NEG this was one of the worst films i can remember seeing i am sure i have seen worse though if that mitigates me slamming itbr br the humor isnt funny there are stupid stereotype jokes that again arent funny i was a captive audience on a plane and viewed this film it was a complete waste of time i enjoyed martin in earlier films but not this one same for queen latifah she was excellent in chicago and in set it off she was good too but this role was horridbr br i mostly credit the failure to the bad writing of the script i feel strongly you cant save a formulaic unfunny script with decent actors this movie as a case in point still all involved should have been wise enough to not participate in this film i am just amazed that something so bad can get greenlighted made released theatrically and promoted
