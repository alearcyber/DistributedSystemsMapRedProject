POS this cartoon documents the second encounter between wile e coyote and the roadrunner and is definitely better than their first meeting in fast and furryous br br if measured by aesthetic value then this cartoon would not rank among the top  or  of the year  regardless this is a very funny short coyote carnivorous vulgaris chases the roadrunner accelerati incredibilus along the road and gets completely tired out the ingenious scientific latin names of the characters are very original and has been mimicked before in other unrelated cartoons the coyote collapses and puts on a wonderful expression of i dont know boredom such jonesesque expressions make this cartoon provide more than its fare share of laughs in seven minutes then he has an idea and another laughable expression is worn the slapstick jokes are all hilarious and mask the fact that it is truly evil to inflict such pain on a poor helpless genius coyote everyone knows but who caresbr br the old rocket gag is present too coyote straps himself to a rocket which should produce enough oomph for him to catch up with roadrunner and grab him instead the rocket shoots up into the air and becomes a firework in the distance eat at joes this classical gag originates from this cartoon though obvious it still makes people laughbr br the highlight truly is the chase through the mineshaft the two wear helmetlights and we see the tunnel through which the two are going with only the lights visible here the comedy reaches a peak a mustsee sequence maybe even the best sequence in the early days of roadrunner the final touch is provided by the writing of michael maltese as coyotes light goes out and he unknowingly lights a match in a room full of explosives the surface is shown where a bunch of cactus jump and spell out the letters yipe after the blast such small things make you laugh all through a mere seven minutes and as soon as it starts the funs all over the rocket skates are another good idea as is the free drink of water and the anvil on the tightrope a sequence that appears in space jam  to give the results of those away would be useless the free drink proves to be a problem for wile e at the end of the secondlast sequence namely the rocket skatesbr br this classical cartoon is littered with fine animation except for the characters though they are animated very well the two characters are very primitive which might be an understatement though at first it may seem weird the humor of the ensuing sequences makes one forgetbr br if you like vintage jones watch this if you love roadrunner get this on video excellent entertainment rating
