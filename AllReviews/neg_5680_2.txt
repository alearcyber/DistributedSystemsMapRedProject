NEG nothing to spoil here at all but this could be a spoiler so bewarebr br special effects were on the level of a video game  about five years ago or perhaps of the original star trek the acting was just pathetic  some cheesy looking blonde treking across the desert while a voice in the background droned on and on and on this was the trek and drone half that i actually made it through progress is interrupted by a few fights ships blow each other up for no real reason that is apparent episodically again its not that there is a real fight that you would expect from a movie more like a cheap video game boiing boiing ship explodes next ship apparently some of the ships are looking for the blonde here in the far future ships must be nearsighted and astigmatic because many of them pass directly overhead of the stylishly dressed futuristic babe in black but never see her br br then there are a couple of choreographed fights that look like something put on by high school kids again the crude video game mentality is prominent the combatants shift to fight mode by flipping something on their wrists and a loud computerized voice echoes and flashes fight mode that must be a dandy design if you are trying to sneak up on somebody then you go to a big power station which looks just like a current day power line tower and plug in to charge back up lol im not kidding you cant make this stuff up its like watching a freaking video game from about  only the acting is better in the gamebr br more trekking then she shows up at the city lame sound trek gets even lamer here she gets into a fight with a mech robot of the future who cannot hit her with his big gun even though she runs right in front of him about five feet in front of him obviously robots of the far future are about as useful as toaster ovens in a fight she throws sand in its eyes and beats it to death by throwing rocks at it rofl i was at about  of tolerance by that point my nausea circuits flashing redbr br in the next scene she ends up strapped to a rocket with some rope i kid you not tied right to the outside of a rocket this is supposed to be an advanced form of transportation at that point i bailed br br this movie is an utter disgrace for a movie made at the present time just a freaking disgrace there was a drippy story but the movie distracted from it  somebody droning on about mother constantly br br i gave it a two because there were a few scenes which displayed some pretty nice artwork of a science fiction nature as background unfortunately the plot acting action cinematography and narrative distracted from this artwork and degraded it no kidding
