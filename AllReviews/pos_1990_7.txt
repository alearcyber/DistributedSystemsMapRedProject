POS an absorbing exploration of virtual reality although it is not yet clear how much the director himself intended this film deliberately takes you through several layers of artificial reality leaving only subtle clues about which layer of virtual reality you are in positing an ontological confusion for the viewer to ponder br br also can be seen as a satire of video games the whole movie though may fall into the fallacy of imitative form here it seems unable to escape from the video game genre which it imitates thus the satire becomes problematic br br a number of interesting ideas crisscross throughout though the biological mutant is one the interface of technology and biology the cyborg urge to transcend reality and philosophical allusions such as the titles to heidegger along with existential questions ie the game characters are partly scripted or determined and yet partly free to alter their fate and they wonder at how strange that feels in the game one character then notes that this existential confusion is just like real life thereby erasing again the distinction between the virtual and the real likewise with the observation that it is unpleasant to stumble around in a world where you dont know what will happen next and youre not sure how to play since you have to stumble around just to find out the goal and the unknown rules a virtual game within the game is titled transcendenz also a critique of how virtual violence makes us unable to feel the effects of real violence even the heroes at every level of ontological existence find themselves confused about violence they dont like it but it is thrilling and part of the game which then they fear is real br br the game creator the god of the system is assassinated in the end yet that very scenario is played out in direct parallel to a video game weve just witnessed and the onlookers believe that it is still just part of the virtual reality in the end the film does not resolve the doubt about whether or not this is real but the point is clear to me anyway existenz means dasein you are there you are thrown into a set of rules and mysteries at every level ontologically virtual reality recapitulates reality and its common game motifs express like a royal road to the unconscious our own fascination with violencebr br nevertheless while cronenberg affirms these philosophical allusions in an interview about the film he claims that he is very much against the reality  underground name of terrorist group portrayed in the film both in the game and in the real level seems that cronenberg himself did not put that much thought into the film though his impressive education comes through the interview in cineaste gives the impression of a middle brow intellectual whos trying to be avantgarde by inclination cronenberg is simply on the side of free imagination  the clichd bourgeois modernist credo despite the acknowledged ambivalence there my impression here might be due to one limited interview still cronenburg seems to miss the point that his film betrays the fallacy of imitative form here imitating computer games while doing a satirical critique of them but a critique that is unable to transcend the same form probably because he actually thinks that it is imaginative and radical yet the films imaginative world is less bearable and more jejune than our own alltooreal world it remains trapped in the computer game worldview
