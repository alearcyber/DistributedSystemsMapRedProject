NEG i didnt expect much from the movie so am not all that disappointed carrie looked ugly mr big had his eyebrows colored with crayons and samantha didnt say f br br charlottes kid was annoying to watch as she was in too many scenesthe title could easily have been satc parents night out camera angles just werent that good especially regarding carries face br br there was a token black woman thrown in whose character doesnt have a proper exit and too few appearances by the gay men friends who seemed thrown in with no purpose anyway samanthas going back and forth from la choked the story flow especially when she comes in for fashion week and nothing happens br br the movie seems to have been made in rush because it could have been good but scenes were just thrown in to show different outfits or to offer viewers a chance to jump back in the show without adding much to the story of the movie
