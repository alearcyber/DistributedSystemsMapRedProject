NEG i figure this to be an alternate reality teen flickmore precisely a ferris bueller type character as the leader of a cheat ring  yeah i know its not meant to compared to ferris bueller at least not in a orangestooranges way but it will nonethelessbr br bottomline its galaxies away from even being even a minor classic it is watchable though only if youre not expecting very much that said the main character has some charm but the premise wears thin because the writing just isnt clever the movie just did not deliver enough laughs twists or tension to keep my interest br br to be honest i did continue watchingwatching with hopes to see if anything suddenly clicked it didnt so stylish as it is i wouldnt recommend this movie btw it seems odd to see mary tyler moore as the principal shes truly miscast i hope the paycheck was inordinately big
