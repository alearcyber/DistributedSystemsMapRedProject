NEG this proved to be a rare case of a poliziottesco made with british funding unfortunately the result is undistinguished except by its exceeding unpleasantness and borderlinecamp approach despite stars and director the former is led by a wooden franco nero and an ultrahammy telly savalas as a couple of wouldbe robbers if anyone is able to believe either actor  who generally exude cool  as a duo of bumbling crooks hes more gullible than i ambr br their job goes awry ending in murder and saddled with cases of cutlery instead of jewels  however the mismatched criminals see an opening to their dilemma when they inadvertently kidnap the son of a british diplomat a miscast lester who even gets to kick triggerhappy savalas where it hurts at one point still they never actually ransom him and their sole intent is to cross the border into france tagging along with them is neros girlfriend a wasted ely galleani soon enough though shes had enough and decides to run away while the others are sleeping the crazy savalas notices this and following the girl kills her in the meantime nero and lester have woken up  the former thinks his accomplices may have doublecrossed him so he goes on the lam with the boy in tow after a brief spell at a rich old ladys country estate which features totally gratuitous rear nudes by both nero and lester savalas catches up with them they continue their trek where the trio run into a family of german campers the situation degenerates to the point where savalas shuts them inside their trailer and tosses the lot into the river  though hes badly hurt in the process himself typically it all ends with the heavies getting killed just as theyre about to reach the borderbr br the film therefore contains most of the genres typical elements  sleaze sadism violence chases the aftermath of the opening robbery when the getaway car causes havoc in the citys narrow backstreets and even disrupts a funeral procession is downright farcical etc one mildly interesting aspect to it is that by the end lester himself is seen to have been definitely irrevocably marked by the experience  coming to feel excitement when an act of violence is committed
