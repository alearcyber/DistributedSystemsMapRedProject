POS empire strikes back director irvin kershners never say never again a remake of the  james bond movie thunderball doesnt surpasses the terence young original but this nonharry saltzman  albert r broccoli film is well worth watching if you call yourself a  aficionado nevertheless despite its shortage of clever gadgets and the lack of a vibrant musical score never say never again rates as an aboveaverage suspenseful doomsday thriller with topflight performances by a seasoned cast including sean connery kim basinger klaus maria brandauer max von sydow barbara carrera edward fox bernie casey alec mccowen and rowan atkinson the film bristles with surprises galore from the invigorating title credits sequence throughout its generally exciting but lengthy  minutes unlike the franchise james bond sagas with their breathtaking moments of spectacle never say never again provides few of these scenes because of its prohibitive budget indeed the film features only three gadgets an explosive ballpoint pen a wristwatch with a laser and a soupedup motorcycle aside from the flavorful lani hall opening theme song ice station zebra composer michel legrands orchestral music score leaves much to be desired legrand replicates none of those snappy jazz cues that made john barrys music for the regular bond franchise so memorable all in all never say never again seems to fit more into the first two bond moviesdr no and from russia with loveand on her majestys secret service in terms of its more down to earth approach to the subject matterbr br never say never again presents sean connerys james bond as an older  who has seen his day and has been taken off active service to teach ironically roger moore was a year older than connery and moores bond movies treated  as an active young guy sean connery seems to be responsible for making  a more mature secret agent and a number of changes take place in the lorenzo semple screenplay that emphasize bonds age initially connery had lobbied to play bond without a hairpiece but mercifully wiser minds prevailed and connery sports a hairpiece he looks tanned and fit and appears in better condition than he did twelve years earlier when he was rushed into diamonds are forever at the last moment to replace john gavin connery had been working on another movie and had gained weight for the role that he was unable to remove in time for diamonds are forever at  connery still has a youthful vigor here despite the contrived demands of the scriptbr br the action unfolds with  singlehandedly trying to rescue a kidnapped woman on a remote desert island he dispatches several guards armed with machine guns and frees the woman only to have her stab him with a knife in the side when he isnt looking it seems that this entire sequence was an exercise designed by m edward fox of day of the jackal to test bonds ability the new m doesnt share his predecessors use of field agents m decides that bond needs to clean out his system of all free radicals and has  packed off to shrublands while at the country clinic bond notices suspicious activity between a nurse and a patient and gets noticed watching them the nurse is none other than spectre assassin fatima blush barbara carrera of the island of dr moreau and she is in charge of making sure that nobody sees usaf officer jack petachi gavan oherlihy of superman  petachi is part of a spectre plan by millionaire businessman maximilian largo klaus maria brandauer of out of africa to black the world powers by stealing two nuclear warheads the villains implant a duplicate eyeball into captain petachi who has access to the highly sophisticated computers and can order the arming of weapons after he steals the weapons for spectre fatima blush runs him off the road by tossing her pet snake in his lap and then attaches an explosive to his wrecked car and blows him up indeed the first part of never say never again apart from the spectre planning conference belong to fatima as she supervises petachis stay at the clinic and then repeatedly tries to kill bond one at sea with sharks and later in a motel suite with an explosives devicebr br eventually bond meets the beautiful blond domino kim basinger of mother lode and sneaks into largos charity banquet at a monte carlo casino where the two face off in an elaborate video game called domination to see who will rule the world bond bests him and largo hates him doubly now because  is his only rival to domino and a thorn in his side that not even fatima seems to be able to remove bond and fatima have it out after a motorcycle chase when he returns the favor and blows her up their earlier encounter in the bahamas when she attached a device to lure a shark after him is pretty lame like in the original thunderball the villains recover the hijacked nuclear warheads at sea but just the warheads themselvesbr br bond flies to the bahamas where he meets his diplomatic liaison nigel smallfawcett no lesser than rowan atkinson of mr bean fame who is worried that bond may kill somebody and ruin the island paradise of course nigel smallfawcett serves as the films source of comic relief the cia sends felix leiter bernie casey of guns of the magnificent seven to back up bond this is the first time that an africanamerican portrayed leiter bond encounters his share of problems involving saving domino from arab slavers while leiter and he save the world never say never again is a richly respectable james bond thriller with many neat touches but it never generates the air of danger that the franchise bond films have indeed never say never again looks like a dignified masterpiece theatre take on
