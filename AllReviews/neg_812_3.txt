NEG outside sweden you are not expected have seen this movie happy you the cast includes several actors that are important part of modern the swedish movie history and still br br seems like peter dalle only had a an idea lasting for about  minutes robert gustafson is totally misused in this movie trying to copy a younger gsta ekman ekman by the way is the only actor fulfilling the expectations br br credit that can be given is for the photo splendid idea using black and white music is okbr br but overall its a waste of god actors and the time of the audience
