NEG this was a very brief episode that appeared in one of the night gallery show back in  the episode starred sue lyon of lolita movie fame and joseph campanella who play a baby sitter and a vampire respectively the vampire hires a baby sitter to watch his child which appears to be some kind of werewolf or monster while he goes out at night for blood the baby sitter is totally oblivious to the vampires appearance when she first sees him and only starts to put two and two together when she notices that he has no reflection in the mirror has an odd collection of books in the library on the occult and hears strange noises while the vampire goes to talk to the child she realizes that the man who hired her may not be what she thought he was originally she bolts out the door the vampire comes out looking puzzled and the episode is over i dont know what purpose it was to make such an abbreviated episode that lasted just  minutes they should just have expanded the earlier episode by those same  minutes and skipped this one a total wasted effort
