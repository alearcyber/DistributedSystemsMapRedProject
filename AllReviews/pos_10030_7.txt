POS i blame birth of a nation myself  for commencing the longrunning tradition of hollywood travesties of history of which there can be few greater examples than this apart from getting the names of custer and his th cavalry crazy horse and the sioux and president grant spelt right the geography correct and the fact that custer and his men were indeed wiped out to a man the rest just takes hyperbole and invention to ludicrous limits throw in some downright hackneyed scenes of the purest exposition try custer and his wifes learning of the phony gold rush to excuse the invasion of the sioux territory custers testimony in front of congress pleading the rights of the red indians and to top it all custers storming into the presidents office to beg to return to his post honestly theres plenty more of the same some of these scenes almost comical in their corniness and yet and yet its still a great actioner with flynn as dashing as ever dehavilland as beguiling as ever the young anthony quinn getting a start as crazy horse and director walsh as barnstorming as ever in his depiction of crowd scenes and of course the tumultuous action sequences ford taught us in liberty valance to believe the legend before the truth here i think were closer to the legend of the legend but hey its only a movie and a rollicking wonderfully enjoyable classic hollywood movie at that
