NEG in order to describe whats seriously wrong with this movie it has to contain some spoilers so if youre going to see it and expect to be surprised dont read thisbr br i liked everything about this movie except the plot and in a thriller like this believable plot is essential it is well acted if a bit slow moving and the camera work and portland scenes are exquisite for a lowbudget unpretentious picture the dialog is very good br br mason is seriously withdrawn youth who works at a telemarketing company selling insurance his high school buddy berkeley is his employer and looks after him like a brother despite the fact that mason is quite obviously mentally ill mason has nightmares which send him gasping and fumbling for his inhaler his visions and nightmares suggest that he has had serious problems with goodlooking women in his past and the movie seems to be suggesting that he may be a serial killer of women he meets a perky pretty girl named amber and he sketches her in his notebook she takes a liking to him and poses for him so he can paint her portrait he sees more of her and begins to awaken from his withdrawn state almost becoming halfway human then something goes wrong amber finds sketchbooks with drawings of other girls and she begins to wonder she becomes frightened and pulls away we are wondering if her sudden coldness is going to push him over the edge his behavior becomes more erratic br br this is the setup for the revelation in order to explain how this movie goes horribly wrong i have to explain what happens another spoiler warning in order for this plot to work we have believe that amber a really outgoing pretty young girl is going to go for a seriously emotionally disturbed young man who at least at the beginning of their friendship has a vacant stare and can only speak in monosyllables or doesnt speak at all hes way beyond nerdy he appears on the verge of total catatonia yes i know girls can be attracted to all kinds of weirdos but usually the charles manson type or punk rockers guys with some kind of evil manic energy mason is practically a zombie hes hardly there at all any perky young thing would cross the street to avoid him it is just not believable that this girl is attracted to him moreover there is no credible reason for berkeley to indulge the crazy mason that just isnt believable either br br but wait theres a revelation amber fails to show up at berkeleys house for christmas dinner where mason is expecting her and berkeley his old buddy has to tell him that amber and all his other former girlfriends the ones he drew in his many sketchbooks dont exist at all she and all the others are merely figments of his twisted imagination he dreamed them up br br well this explains why a normal cute amber would go for mason shes just a figment of his imagination this could have been the final revelation of the movie with the proper preparation and setup but alas its not at this point mason runs back to his apartment and finds amber therehes enraged he kills her but now we are given to understand that amber was in fact real not masons imaginary girlfriend br br in the end after being given proof that amber actually exists and that mason killed her berkeley has to admit that he was wrong that he misjudged mason this would work if mason had been halfway sane from the beginning but because we the audience always suspected him of being totally deranged and possibly a killer of women it is no surprise to us we suspected what he was all along and cant understand why berkeley couldnt see it but then we are once again left to wonder if she was real why amber would be attracted to the catatonic mason br br to make the ending worse we are never given to understand whether all the other of masons girlfriends the ones in the sketchbooks were real or was amber the first real one and if the others were real did he kill them too what did he do with the bodies br br the problem is that the filmmakers just didnt know what to do with the material perhaps there could have been a way to straighten it out and tell a credible suspense story but this movie is not that
