NEG one of the first things i noticed that allowed this culture to stand out among the rest was during the wake at soles place an aerial shot is used to show sole being flowered with kisses by a sea of women i believed this was a commentary on the closeness that women had for each other of this cultureones who stuck together across the generations separations and misunderstandings and still being able to bond and rely on each other also the film seemed to glorify women as almost flawless individuals what i mean by flawless is that they did not suffer the consequences for their actions and were treated as if they had no imperfections an example of this is shortly after paula accidentally killed her father her mother immediately comes to her rescue and takes full responsibility for the act while paula seems to suffer almost no remorse for what she has done again another example of this is when each daughter or granddaughter has had an opportunity to reunite with their supposed dead mother grandmother knowing the stresses that this has most likely caused in their family each one of them still embraces the mother without care for what she has donethat is killing her husband and his lover in this light women are portrayed as ones who not only love each other independent of character acts but also ones who dont seem bothered in the least by the acts in which their friendsfamily members performbr br another idea that i thought was intriguing of this culture was in regards to their idea of the supernatural with the death of raimunda and soles mother and her inexplicable return the director builds the audiences emotions to believe that this film is going to embody the supernatural the people depicted in this culture seem very supernatural that is to say very eager to believe that life exists beyond the grave their aunt longtime friend augustina the prostitute and other people living in the city of la mancha all believe the rumors of the dead coming back to family members to finish the unfinished business i believed this was a mixed reflection of the cultures religious faith predominantly catholic as well as their need to make amends with those who had no chance to be forgiven during mortality the belief they held in regards to the dead being alive was also to give hope to the destitute circumstances they suffered in mortality when the viewer is exposed to the fact that this film isnt supernatural at all its interesting to observe the role the mother continues to play shes treated as if she still is a ghost ie hiding in small crevices underneath the bed or inside a car trunk i believe the director portrayed the mother this way to heighten the already existent supernatural beliefs the city had adopted the mothers character seemed to be a metaphor for the citys longheld belief in life after death
