POS this is certainly a quality movie with a classy cast as far as movies about carlos the jackal go this one beats bruce willis feeble efforts in the jackal to a bloody pulp then spits on them i am a bit surprised that this movie hasnt attracted more votes something of a sleeper obviously a pity because this film is definitely worth a watch it is clever and never dull see it
