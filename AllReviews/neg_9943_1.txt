NEG ive watched hundreds of kung fu movies and ive heard some good thing about this movie so i decided to give it a try what i saw was one of the worst displays of movie making ive ever seenbr br i cant help but feel like the director want to have every muscle guy in hong kong in this movie everyone overacts to the point of stupidity even conan the barbarian had some civility this movie just has halfevolved men screaming in every scene and stupid women who has no selfrespect the narrators character shouldve be killed for sucking so muchshe really didnt deserve to live til the end the entire movie was a melodramatic mess with horrible acting bad directing and bad action they shouldve just rename this movie to the stupid onearmed caveman with a blade heres a questionwhy do some director use quick cuts for some action movies answer to can hide the deficiencies of the actors nearly every scene was close up and quickly cut without any kind of flow the movie tried so hard to show intensity but it became almost laughable please stay away from this movie it you have any kind of taste in kungfu moviesor any taste in movies
