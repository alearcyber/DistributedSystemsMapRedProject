POS if this film had been directed by dw griffith or stanley kubrick it would be recognized for what it is a cinematic masterpiece told with depth and subtlety and passion a film with no equal in the visual realm it is unremittingly stunning and also very brutal in its depiction of our great heritage of greed and annihilation and of course what the reviewers could not abide is it doesnt tell a simple narrative dickandjane tale like  of hollywood output its characters are complex and confused by their passions and thoughts fears and emotions they even appear to be thinking something your average movie reviewers do not understand and cannot abide so they destroyed it see the original uncut widescreen version it is stunning
