NEG it is real easy to toast roast flay and otherwise burn this film for all of its abundant flaws it was made by high school students and faculty and a whole community it shows sure i could examine the script which is just ridiculous a monster created from the garbage of a growing californian city starts eating garbage and taking garbage cans all over the city soon this huge beast with wings no less begins to destroy buildings and even plays the beauty and the beast act with a young high school girl fortunately for her there is a gang of guys her former boyfriend nicknamed the penguin and the town drunk out to help her the direction is awful the production values just dreadful the acting nonexistent and the pace sluggish the movie is hard to sit through  period however that being said it is also a miracle of a film when you consider that this thing was crafted by an entire community you can see all the collective effort from the actors the actual mayor and actual firemen and policemen to the area location shots used i also was really amazed at all the local businesses credited at the films end with helping to finance or contribute in some way to the film when you look at the film from that perspective it is indeed quite an achievement i didnt know anything about it before i sat down and watched it now that i have found out something about it i am impressed but make no mistake  i have nonodesire to sit through it again
