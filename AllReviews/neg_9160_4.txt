NEG the writers missed so many opportunities and created so many plot holesbr br example when dave retrieved his keyboard from the rain i was eagerly anticipating the funny sounds that were going to come out of it nothing are you kidding me a truly witty writer would have not only had a field day with that but it would have eliminated the major problem of the entire audience wondering how a digital keyboard can become completely soaked but then work perfectlybr br there were at least  other similar situations overall small children will enjoy this parents will endure it without too much complaining
