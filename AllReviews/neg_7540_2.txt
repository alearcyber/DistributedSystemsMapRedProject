NEG the film is set in newcastle on tyne in north east england the town where i was born and grew up the film is also fundamentally dishonest  the way it presents the town the kids but above all the men of the town in this film they are all stupid violent thieving thugsbr br i suppose i could comment on the plot predictable the performances competently unattractive the direction lazy and unimaginative but to me that is all irrelevant compared to the directors insult to the town and its peoplebr br thus the invitation in my summary to the director and writer mark herman to leave the north east
