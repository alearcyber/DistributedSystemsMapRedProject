POS a nice and pleasant movie full of meditteranean sceneries cephallonia is a very beautiful greek island that keeps many of the novels characteristics i think that greek sceneries add something special and magical to a movie one thing i didnt like at all though is that the main characters like mandras and pelagias father werent greek actors but foreigners i mean the actors tried to express the greek way of living but to me they didnt succeed and it was quite clear even their pronunciation when they were trying to use greek words was terrible and that was bad for the films plot irene papas was really great in her role a typical example of a mother living in a island during the s who has lost her husband and tries to live a child alone john hurt pelagias father also acted great he reminded me a greek in many of his reactions
