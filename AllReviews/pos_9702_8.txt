POS my sister a friend and i went to see this film for my birthday on the th of september we had all seen the first jackass movie a while back and we all enjoyed it we were really looking forward to number twobr br we were not disappointedbr br from start to finish i was laughing hysterically it is equal parts shocking and amusing however and is definitely not for those with weak stomaches it is obscene but it is also groundbreaking american cinema well perhaps thats a bit too much praise for a movie where men intentionally get their scrotums stuck to ice sculptures but it is groundbreaking in that it shows us obscenities whether we like it or not things that no other decent american movie released nationwide would dare show usbr br there was only one scene in particular that i felt was unnecessarily obscene and it involved a horse  ill not elaboratebr br i laughed i nearly gagged and i came damnclose to crying out of a physical reaction to viewing a scene involving a leech and an eyeball not sadness in my humble opinion jackass number two is the film of br br does that make me a jackass perhaps but if it does i could really care less
