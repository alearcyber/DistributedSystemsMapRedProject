POS now after watching the advent children twice the storyline isnt as shallow as majority has criticized it to be in my opinion if you havent played ffvii or disliked it for whatever reason this movie is most likely not for you being familiar to the original story is a prerequisite to understanding ac fully otherwise you will just see the greatest cg animation in your life so farbr br without actually spoiling the storyline i must admit that after seeing ac we have been putting pieces together with my friends relying on our knowledge of ffvii seeing it second time allowed to actually pay attention to the story more and most of the questions we may have had were answered some were not ac is clearly for ffvii playersfans and doesnt honestly try to be anything else there is little to none realism in it outside ffvii world which serves the purpose music is mostly reconstructed ffvii themes with a heavier touch tbm team according to end credits and works well with the eye candy without exceptions i found the music enhancing the experience added to the visual fireworks in all situationsbr br we all know you cant put a ffvii in  hours and keeping that in mind the storyline actually offered more to me than i expected there are two issues at hand in ffvii  ac and both stories were wrapped up very smoothly between the action sequences and trust me when i say theres a lot of it action that isbr br im changing my vote from  to  after watching it the second time because i had missed a few explanatory sequences i couldnt put together the first time that provided some answers as a warning its going to be easy to disregard the story and concentrate on graphics but try not to judge the adevent children because of that if you dont let the story in its no wonder it seems sloppybr br im not going to praise the graphics because i assume we all know they are awesome which might be an understatement especially characters talk so much more with their facial expressions than ever before i hope you pay attention to the storyline for it actually makes sense and works well with the whole get ready for the ride of your life there are no breaks
