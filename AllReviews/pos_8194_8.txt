POS for a feature film the plot closely follows historyor at least historical gossip but then the chinese who know the story very well from seeing it portrayed again and again would never tolerate it otherwise the attention to detail is wonderful especially for anyone who has read sima qians account in the records of the historian jing ke according to sima qian did indeed make an attempt on qin shi huangs life at the request of the crown prince of yan before unification sima qian explicitly mentions both the head of general fan and the dagger rolled up into the map as well as the dagger being thrown into the brass column although jing ke is described as no stranger to swordplay hes hardly the invincible warrior portrayed by chen kaige jing ke is indeed this films weakest link in reality again according to sima qian he was a heavy drinker and put off his visit to qin for as long as possible spending a good deal of time with the ladies of yan before the crown prince finally ordered him on his way he was in short a human being and was not looking forward to death although he was willing to accept it chen kaiges jing ke is afraid of death but not his own he is the classic ruthless killer turned disillusioned pacifist his love or maybe just affection for a woman and pity for several hundred children whom zheng had buried alive not even two thousand years of hostile confucian historians claimed qin shi huang did this although there is a legend about him burying  confucians up to their necks and then beheading themis enough to make this former assassin kill again the melodrama is not convincing and the character ends up being just plain boring the acting here isnt shabby though not very interesting given the character as for lady zhou in all the numerous stories ive heard about qin shi huang shes never come up anyway gong li is famous enough for americans to have heard of her thanks to zhang yimou and there needed to be a love interest so here she is its unfortunate that her performance is almost as wooden as jing kes character shes done much better in qiu ju for example at being subtle here she just barely manages presence but all of this is trivial compared to the extraordinary acting of li xuejian as zheng himself qin shi huang is for the chinese rather what miltons satan is for us accepted as a villain but a noble one qin shi huangs accomplishments radiate an awe all the way across two thousand years into the present and li captures his frightening will without compromising his humanity lis performance is enough but the scope of the film is grand although the photography is purposely drab it does feel ancient the score is adequate scarcely moving though very appropriate to the action though ive only seen it once i believe that chen kaige should be given more credit for his camera work than other reviewers have allowed him the opening credits are exhilarating if five stars its absolutely average i given three more for li xuejians acting and chen kaige as an actor writer and director
