NEG regardless of whether the predominant social message of this film  that vigilante justice is acceptable  is justifiable i was more insulted by mcconaugheys closing statement in a courtroom drama the closing statement of the defence attorney is pretty much the crux of the film and when the issue is as difficult to resolve as this one the statement is really being delivered to the audience as well as the jury this basically implies that the audience consider the rape of a white girl to be a more horrific crime than the rape of a black girl i for one find this very insulting as for the rest i found the acting reasonable with the exception of sandra bullock who seems to be playing her usual bubbly self doesnt really work in a courtroom drama but whats the point when the films message is as poor as this one it tells you that vigilante justice is fine and accuses you of racism if you disagree
