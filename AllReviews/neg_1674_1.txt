NEG i dont know if this type of movie was as clich then as it seems to be nowbr br considering how many bad news bears films had already been released by  however i think that this sort of movie was already a tired ideabr br a former football player is partially paralyzed in vietnam and is confined to a wheelchair the chicago bears offer him a pr job but he wants to coach at the same time his underage nephew is picked up for armed robbery we are told that he has already been arrested over a dozen times before and he must now serve some hard timewhich turns out to be less than a year br br of course the kid is actually a good kid who only needs a tough male role model in his life the same goes for all of the kids in the detention facility yeseven the one locked up for attempted murder im sure you already know what happens so ill try and keep the rest of this briefbr br our protagonist becomes the coach of the kids football team he overcomes the delinquents cynicism and earns their respect his team faces off against a local high school team yeah right and they get their butts kicked now determined more than ever to prove himself a worthy coach he demands a rematch will these underprivileged scrappy kids with hearts of gold be able to improve enough to win the rematch awful execution of the football sequences ruins any possibility of excitement in this film coach of the year should get penalized for roughing my brain
