NEG put simply this miniseries was terrible let me count the ways  absurd plotting  overacting  scattershot approach to characters  annoying narration  inability to create viewer interestbr br this film cant even pass the soap opera for dummies test im sorry i have not read this awardwinning novel so i am judging it only as a film but it really stinks imagine going to a party where they show you dozens of appetizers you look at the wide variety and want to taste them but suddenly they are withdrawn and you wonder where they went thats like this film with way too many characters introduced and never drawn out there are enough stories and characters in this film to create a  episode series yet we are given less than four hours to digest it allbr br there are more facial expressions and reaction shots of ed harris than youll find on  monkeys the pace is extraordinarily slow br br dennis farina and helen hunt are so far overthetop that their characters are not believable joanne woodwards character is onedimensional br br the persistent river metaphor becomes tritebr br and probably the most absurd part of the filmthe cat this evil and vengeful cat who follows the hero around to scratch him and his seat coverswell come on nowits not even good stephen kingbr br probably the most interesting character in the film and one who is not drawn well is john voss the disturbed boy whose final act of desperation accounts for the only plot device that works in this filmbr br just about everyone in this film is unbelievablebr br to sum up theres little here to inspire the drama is poor melodrama its just a terrible effort
