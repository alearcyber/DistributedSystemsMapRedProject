NEG i often wonder how movies like this even get made and the most shocking part is that people actually pay to watch thembr br with aksar it appears as though the director made up the story as he went along adding twists and turns when he liked no matter how ludicrous they were the script was non existent with inane dialogs such as jo sheena roy pehenti hai wahee fashion hota hai and yeh versace hai madam yeah rightbr br every one of the characters was shallow and underdeveloped acting was awful constumes lycra for udita and awful suits for a stocky emran locales the numerous houses that were used for interiors did not even vaguely resemble a victorian mansion screenplay etc etc just one word rubbishbr br for those people who love hashmi and his movies watch it as for me ill never get those two and a half hours back the only redeeming factor was some of the music which was decent
