NEG i saw the greek tycoon when it first came out in  i found it extremely boring i thought it was no better than a travelogue except for one thing for the first time in my life i realized why it would be good to be rich seeing the scenery off aristotle onassis yacht and getting my first real peek into the lifestyle of the rich and famous opened my eyes to paraphrase martha stewart it was a good thing funny i dont remember the sex scene i hadnt seen the movie since it was on the big screen and found the lovemaking session with the mistress memorable this time maybe because i was younger and single back then it was no big deal
