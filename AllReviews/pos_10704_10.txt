POS unlike the previous poster i liked the celluloid treatment it looked good and made the movie that much more enjoyable to watch to me it didnt detract at all from the power of the documentarys content in fact i felt the slickness of the look allowed me to just lose myself that much more in the content the previous poster was fair to liken the style to a nike commercial it definitely has that look but for my tastes it worked really well and i am far from a fan of nike commercialsbr br in my opinion this is how documentary filmmaking should be done i cant wait to see the next installments from these promising filmmakers
