POS i recently was lucky enough to see the kite runner in a small theater surrounded by seasoned moviegoers who knew how to enjoy a masterpiece of such sophistication with all the controversy surrounding this films central scene these days i was expecting a piece both crude and violent but the way mr forster handled the delicate subject was touching and really deeply moving even though the films credits indicated china as the main location for the shoot i could have sworn i was seeing kabul throughout the scenes which are meant to be taking place in afghanistan the acting by nonprofessionals as well as professional actors is excellent and the casting is magnificent so this is a movie i would see again and again because though it is undeniably sad in its subject the masterful way it has been made awakens a whole new hope in modern cinema
