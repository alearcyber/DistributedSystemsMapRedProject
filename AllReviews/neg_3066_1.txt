NEG i rented this pile of sewer waste hoping for a few good laughs with a title like zombie bikers from detroit and with dead alive productions stamped on the front cover you would think that this could be a funnygruesome film but no this is the worst movie i have ever seen and yes i have seen all of the police academy movies the story this is a joke within itself and the dialogue are atrocious the make up of the socalled zombies looks like they used one of those two dollar make yourself look like a zombie kits that you buy at kmartbr br i would rather watch beverly hills  while listening to the backstreet boys and be whipped by a lb novelty birthday card model than to sit through another single minute of this pathetic excuse for a dvd honestly i could make a better movie with  some popsicle sticks and a slinky i feel as if  minutes of my life were stripped away from me and taken to the land of suckdom i know that tagging on the dead alive production doesnt guarantee a great flick but you do expect to get your moneys worthbr br the only thing that made me happy save returning the horrid mass of elephant feces was that it wasnt titled biker zombies from pittsburgh i feel for detroit folks that wasted their hardearned money on this one unless you have been lobotomized  do not buy rent if you must  but  you will regret it
