NEG a movie about a mysterious love letter that puts a small town on its ear should be fun romantic and easygoing entertainment instead this movie is more about things not said and not expressed so it gets to the point where you are grateful anything is said at all even if the dialogue is not exactly quotable br br spoiler br br when the relationship that says the most is the one least seen on the screen danner and mcewan you know youre in trouble but those two actresses are a very welcome sight in a movie screaming for some genuine peoplebr br end of spoilerbr br capshaw is given the task of creating a character from not much and she is not entirely successful like i said above the theme seems to be repression and i understand that is an element of life and love but i dont want to see a movie about it either at least not this one br br i cant recommend this at all despite the very talented cast who are left to fend for themselves
