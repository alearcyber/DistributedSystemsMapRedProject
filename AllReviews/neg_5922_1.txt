NEG i mistakenly thought that this neonoir effort from the buffalo  niagara falls area might be something different unfortunately i was incorrect there are are many problems with the falls that really have nothing to do with its low budget video production immediately one has to question why all the constant narration my feeling is that if you have a decent script the audience will follow along without having to be insulted with voice over storytelling the acting is very amateurish which is not unexpected but simply adds to the problems finally the entire thing is annoyingly shot like an mtv music video which i found to be totally unacceptable the narration bad acting and annoying video effects are all good reasons why this should be avoided  merk
