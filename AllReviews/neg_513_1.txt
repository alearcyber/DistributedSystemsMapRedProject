NEG don wilson stars as jack cutter ooh real tough namea vampire slayer who goes up against a vampire army you see the story is a little different because vampires cant be killed with silver crosses or sunlight but rather through snapping their necks how convenient as it cuts down on the budget and its here cutter runs into a reporter melanie smith of trancers iii fame night hunters action sequences shake for no reason during the fight sequences and although its meant to emphasize the mood it just makes the movie more jarring what is worse is that these fight sequences are botched beyond belief as wilsons martial artistry is disguised by disjointed editing of course the most interest comes from the fact that indeed this predates blade however the problem is that this was done on a small budget and that it had don wilson in it its from roger corman and basically this turkey is a movie most people would pay not to see i unfortunately am a bottom feeder and i cater to the section of the store looking for gems in this line of work you always run into turds with night hunter i just may have the worlds stinkiest turdbr br  out of awful
