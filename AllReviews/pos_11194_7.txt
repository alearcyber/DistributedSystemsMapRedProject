POS my interpretation is that the term distant is used in the sense of the opposite of warm people who are not warm toward others the film reminds me of the teachings of the dalai lama in the art of happiness where his main point is that the key to happiness is connecting with others not only are the characters in the film insular but they are also humorless charmless shy quiet and unfriendly these characteristics appear to prevent them amongst other things from forming and enjoying relationships and being able to talk about and deal with their problems and as a result they are terribly unhappy i see it as a strong vindication of the dalai lamas teaching im not a buddist by the way if you are one of the people who thinks that their behavior is a natural response to living in a large city then i think you may be right but i recommend the dalai lamas book city life need not be like thisbr br i can see why some people found it boring  it does drag a bit in places and the characters are not particularly likable and it does contrast to lost in translation where the insular characters are much more likable and do connect with one another even though they dont connect with people generally
