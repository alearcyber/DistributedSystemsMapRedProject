NEG bad personal opinion the folks who made it they knew that when they made it to star in this movie again my opinion you needed to meet three criteria   you had to own your own goth style clothing and jewelry makes wardrobe both easier and cheaper that way  you had to be able to remember and repeat your lines with out cue cards note that i didnt say you had to do it well saves on time and paper work  you had to be willing to get naked gives an r rating and thus bolsters sales want to watch a better movie easy get a camera and some of your buddies together and do it yourself trust me you wont do any worse as vampire movies go well this one sucks and a hint here for people like me who like to look for little oddities in movies  consider the link between vampires and crosses now take a look at the symbols and names on the headstones in the cemetery portions of this thing were filmed in ed wood couldnt have planned that kind of an accident any better himself
