POS this is a film that i love above all others i try to revisit the main film locations in oakworth and oxenhope whenever i can which help to reestablish those magical qualities that this film seems to embody so uniquely  recalling a gentler and more mannered age with its unspoken assertions that people really do matter that family life is not just another disposable and that life really is worth living though sometimes we may doubt that in short a film that soon brings tears to my eyes helped perhaps by the deeply evocative music  some tunes are jaunty like the perks tune played on a trombone sometimes with spoons the stirring melody when the family first set off for yorkshire not knowing what lies ahead and the haunting little tune played on a solo clarinet or is it an oboe that precedes sudden childfelt changes in fortunebr br this is as much a film for adults as for children appealing to the eternal child in us all  a key that effortlessly reactivates those deep and apparently longlost values and feelings buried inside us which are normally swept aside by the demands of modern everyday life this is a film about basic human goodness and decency in which we the viewers are left to make of it what we will and there are welcome touches of humour sometimes added for good measure such as the arrival of the aunt or on a more earthy level the bedroom scene on perks birthday  all right bert  as its your birthday i must know every scene every line of this film and yet so great is the magic that each time i watch it is like i am opening a box of delights for the first time savouring each moment  sometimes humorous sometimeswell very different as peter says in the film its perfect  more perfect than you know and so it is
