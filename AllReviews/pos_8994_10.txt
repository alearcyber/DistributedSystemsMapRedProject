POS i wanted to see this movie ever since the previews came out i dont understand why everyone is so hard on this film it may not all be technically true to the sport of rugby but this film is not mainly about the sport its about a rugby team that is taught how to be more than the world expects of them they are taught to become men and not temporally vain boys hollywood is never  correct in their productions they are there to make a product that sells something entertaining the story of coach gelwix and what he has taught over the years is simply amazing he teaches about service honor integrity and moral cleanliness how many other movies are teaching that to our youth these days i was proud to see such an amazing story that taught reverence and respect
