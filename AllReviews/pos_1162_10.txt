POS this is one of my all time favourites all the actors do a great job comparing this movie to lawrence of arabia does no justice to both movies the wind and the lion levels a much lower budget with fantastic actors portraying heartwarming characters in a heartwarming atmosphere action and beautiful pictures are provided as well which all together guarantees a favourite movie to me
