NEG of all the kids movies i have seen over the years this was probably the worst i took four kids aged from  to  and none of them liked itbr br the script seemed to be based on a willy wonka style story but it just didnt have anything to itbr br if you are considering seeing this movie dont waste your time it is badbr br they are making a sequel so it may be worth watching to see if they can even make a worse movie but i dont think it is possible
