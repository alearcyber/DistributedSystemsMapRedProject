POS when i die someone will bury me and if they dont whats the difference who gives a damn huh thus the philosophy of life or lack there of is summed up once and for all in this less than classic but nevertheless fun spinoff of sergio leones dollars trilogybr br in the opening scene three obviously evil gunmen ride into a western town and with menacing glares they intimidate all the pathetic normal people hiding in their homes the observant watcher will notice that each of these three bears a striking resemblance to characters from leones for a few dollars more there is one guy in eastwoods poncho one in lee van cleefs black suit and one seeming to act like gian marie volontes indio but this movie is not about these guys no sooner do they ride into town when they are gunned down by someone even cooler than they a mysterious bounty hunter known simply as the strangerbr br no this is an altogether different storybr br in an obvious copying of leones the good the bad and the ugly three gunmen are again vying for a hidden treasure once again there is the bounty hunter and the mexican bandit the stranger george hilton is a supercool bounty hunter with a penchant for shooting people while dressed up like a priest he is after the reward for the bandit monetero gilbert roland but when moneteros gang steals three hundred thousand in gold coins the stranger gets sidetracked from his normal line of workbr br to round off the trio there is edd byrnes corrupt bank executive clayton he too wants the money for himself but after the money is hidden away the only man who knows where it is gets shot now the only clue to the hiding place is a medallion that shows a family crest the game is too find the treasure before anyone else does and any gun can playbr br with plenty of gunfights fist fights and double crosses the action takes these three to the ultimate showdown ripoff a three way draw for the hidden treasure ala the good the bad and the ugly  but with a twistbr br this movie is not as good as leones films of course but in the end who gives a damn huh this movie is fun  s nihilism spaghetti western style there are no rules no enduring loyalties and no right or wrong  just the treasure and whatever it takes to get it and though the movie is not classic the ending surely is hey maybe we all can get along after all for a hundred thousand a piecebr br if you like spaghetti westerns check this one out it is fast furious and worth the look
