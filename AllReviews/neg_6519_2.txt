NEG this film attempts to cash in on the success of richard curtis movies particularly love actually which i loved  a series of disparate scenes following the love lives of various couples br br its a great idea poorly executed the script tries to be a little too clever and simply doesnt resonate most of the acting is stilted which is more a reflection on the director than the actorsbr br the version i saw on a plane was called scenes from a park which is a more appropriate title as not all the scenes were of a sexual naturebr br i was so looking forward to this movie but ultimately it is disappointing dont bother
