NEG because i would have never ever seen this movie through to the end although there are some but not many funny moments in this movie i couldnt understand more than about the fancy english couple in the rd story included of what people were saying three short stories none with a real point with just some of the most miserable and lifeless people i could have imagined and a load of foul language didnt find it funny didnt find it amusing didnt find any sense in it
