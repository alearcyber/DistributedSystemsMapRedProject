POS  park avenue well the name mystifies initially being an address from new york and film being set in kolkata however as the story unfolds one realize the thin line that director tries to walk between relationships social cause and of course the world of schizophrenia i would say aparna sen is one director who has so much more to say and has so less time at disposal well no doubt she has managed to make a good movie in a way she makes us realize that probably each one of us is looking for our own  park avenue its an unending search within each of one of usbr br the powerhouse performance from shabana azmi is a treat to watch her screen presence brings whole lot of life into the scene indeed it was surprising to see her in such a powerful act after long because i expected it to be all the way konkona sens terrain shabana makes you feel skin deep of an elder sister who is running the whole show for a rather unfortunate family and during this time she almost forgets to live her own life she burdens all her ambitions and desires with ailing  year younger sister  who is more like a daughter to her  and an aging mother played by veteran waheeda rehman as for the leading actress from guide  thats how i can recall her instantly  there is hardly anything to say except few lines and tear drops here and there ever dependable rahul bose plays another pivotal role in the film he shows the emotions of a middle age man with repent on his face to near perfection this man really amazes me with the variety of work he has done from a musician in jhankar beats to a liberal muslim in mr  mrs iyer and so many others he is one versatile i really wish if he had some more shots in the first part of the movie as well the cameo in the movie is by shefali shah remember satya and monsoon wedding she looks really beautiful and depicts the role of a mother of  kids with real ease she gives you a glimpse of todays indian woman who is modern in approach but still conventional when it comes to her husbands prior relationships br br the focus of camera has been meethi portrayed by konkona she and her schizophrenic world constitute the nucleus of  park avenue she has really worked hard for the character but there are times when she is not able to relate with the audience the fateful accident of her life tries to rope in sympathy and it has been only partially successful br br the movie tries to address quite a few things in one go starting from the unique world of a disabled person to the unequal status of a female even in todays modern india and also the twisted relationships in a tattered family and i believe aparna has succeeded to certain extent the helplessness of meethi while she works as a journalist in a rural eastern state really gives us all a naked picture of the country we are so proud of br br well after i finished  park avenue there was a sense of unquenched thirst within me i wanted more out of this movie to drench me emotionally it has been a commendable effort on the part of director except few hiccups must watch for all those who like to see a different cinema something with a strong purpose
