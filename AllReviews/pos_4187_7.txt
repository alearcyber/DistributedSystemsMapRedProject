POS sadly this movie is relegated to curio status it seems many people that ive asked did you know the monkees made a movie usually answer no that being said if you are one of that large number i recommend you see it but with the following caveats if you expect monkey style humor it is in there its just not all over the place like the tv showsbr br yes they are trying to break their tv mold a bit by poking fun at it like a bunch of nolongerteenagers who have been on the short end of a lot of sticksbr br no you dont have to be inebriated to enjoy itbr br no you dont have to be inebriated to understand itbr br if you like classics youll love the interspersed clips throughoutbr br if you like the psychedelic era youll love some of the cameosbr br if you are a monkees fan you might recognize some of the jabs they are taking at the heavy commercializing of the bandbr br in the nighimmortal words of one of my best friends after seeing  minutes of it this is a weird movie man in fact it might be better if you dont try to understand it just sit back and react to it its weird its funny its a bit surreal its experimental stillit is many things overall it is an experience
