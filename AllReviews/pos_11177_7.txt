POS being a huge diehard monkey island fan i fugured this one would be terrible since ron gilbert didnt make it boy was i surprised although its still not as good as the first two it has the comedy that i wanted i was a little nervous about the new graphics new scumm engine and just the fact that it was on a cd but it all came together and it was interesting to finally hear the voices of your favorite characters i especially enjoyed that sword fighting had returned and the whole story about finding the big uncursed ring was just incredible go ahead and try out this twocd adventure and now we can rejoice because monkey island escape from monkey island is coming out really really soon this fall
