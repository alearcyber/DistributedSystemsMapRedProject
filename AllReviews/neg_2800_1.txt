NEG few videos in recent history have been as amateurishly produced as this one  at least none that have been released by such a reputable distributor every frame of this film is a plaguerism of better films of the past the word cliche is given new meaning by a talentless writerdirector who should reserve his imagination for lesser masturbatory efforts that dont victimize film viewers assisting in the amateur night horror effort is a number of less than capable technicians who contribute poor cinematography and laughable makeup and special effects unfortunately the one or two of the amateur actors in the film who display a hint of talent that will go unnoticed due to the reputation that this atrocity will produce
