POS this is both an entertaining and a touching version of the classic tale also quite intelligent not of the me tarzan you jane school at allbr br its the famous story of a child reared to manhood in the jungle by apes a titled british couple the wife pregnant is stranded in the african wilds after a shipwreck after the parents deaths the baby is raised in the jungle by apes twenty years later this young man ie tarzan rescues a wounded belgian explorer nursing him back to health the belgian discovers evidence that his rescuer is the young lord greystoke and returns him to his rightful estate in scotland where he must adjust to civilized society br br the movie is sort of divided into two parts in the first half we see tarzan in his jungle environment not being an expert i am unaware as to the realism of its depiction of ape community life but it is certainly entertaining for me the more moving section is the second half when tarzan must meet his real family develop language skills and adjust to aristocratic british society all the while wooing jane andie macdowell he is portrayed as a noble savage whether in the wild or in elegant edwardian parlors by contrast the upper crust is depicted as often far more barbaric than the jungle tarzan leftbr br christopher lambert is fantastic in his sympathetic portrayal of tarzan in both the jungle and civilized environments he conveys a real sense of his confusion and conflict torn as he is between the two very different worlds his original ape family and his new human one sir ralph richardson one of the old british legends is brilliant as always in the role of tarzans grandfather the sixth earl of greystoke br br the film focuses more on tarzans struggles in adapting to civilization and his inner conflict than on his jungle exploits this unusual take on the old classic makes it both the typical dramatic adventure but also above all a moving personal story i wasnt surprised to note here that its director is the same individual hugh hudson who also directed chariots of fire another brilliant movie
