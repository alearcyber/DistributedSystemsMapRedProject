NEG i waited quite awhile till i was able to watch this lone ranger movie i finally got to see it on the lone star channel today and was very disappointed in the whole movie clayton moore and john hart acted better lone rangers and jay silverheels as tonto than the two stars in this movie very poor acting was done by everyone in this movie even the plot was bad and far fetching i believe the horse portraying silver was the best actor throughout this moviei am glad i didnt go out and buy a copy of this movie when it first came out as i feel its a waste of good money i am truly sorry the characters that clayton moore john hart and jay silverheels played and brought to life on the silver screen have been tarnished so badly unless in the future they find actors worthy of portraying the characters in the same manner which clayton john and jay did so well in the past ill not spend the money to buy the movie ill not watch this movie againbr br wayne davies
