POS in the universal series of modern sherlock holmes stories with basil rathbone and nigel bruce sherlock holmes and the secret weopon is not one of the top films  although it is entertaining i think the problem with it is that much of the films dueling between holmes and his nemesis moriarty here played by lionel atwill seems to delay the actual point of the professors workbr br moriarty appears in three of the holmes films with rathbone in the adventures of sherlock holmes he was played by george zucco who gave real relish to the love of villainy for its own sake to the role for my money zuccos performance as the professor was the best of the three there is even a brief moment of comedy in his performance when hes disguised as the sergeant of police towards the end  like hes preparing to sing a policemans lot from gilbert  sullivan next comes mr atwills performance here  more of that later finally there is henry daniells intellectual moriarty in sherlock holmes and the lady in green its a typically cool classy performance by mr daniell but his confrontations with holmes seem to be a tedious bore to him they keep him from completing the main plan in the stories that the professor pops up in he really senses holmes is a nemesis who will remain a danger as long as he is alive yet because of the intellectual tennis match between him and rathbone rathbone in his autobiography actually felt daniell was the best of the film moriartysbr br if zucco captured the love of evil in the professor and daniell seemed to demonstrate the tired oxford don in the stories the professor is a well regarded mathematician whose volume on the binomial theorem had a european vogue and who wrote an intriguing book the dynamics of the asteroid atwill demonstrates the professor as pragmatic businessman first of all hes sold his services apparently to nazi germany this is never gone into but one presumes as this is before the nazis began to really collapse he figures they will win the war secondly he is not a fool when dr tobel william post jr has shown he is a state of near physical collapse due to the torturing of moriartys gang the professor decides to kidnap one of the other scientists who are assisting tobel because hes as good a scientist as tobel and would be able to put together the bomb site i somehow cant quite see zucco making such a sensible decision on the spot and if daniell had to make it he would seem annoyed that there is yet another delay to his plansbr br by the way one trick used in all the holmes series regarding the professor is how to rid the film of him if you read the holmes stories moriarty appears as the villain three times in the memoirs of sherlock holmes last story the adventure of the final problem in the return of sherlock holmes first story the adventure of the empty house and the last of the four novelsnovellas the valley of fear its amazing how much mileage the professor got out of so few appearances he is mentioned in two or three other stories as well  in passing but because of his fate at the reichenbach falls in the final problem and the empty house we always see him fall to his death zucco falls off the white tower on tower hill daniell with more imagination tries to flee gregson and the police but is shot as he jumps and wounded fails to hold on to the wall of an adjacent building atwill here it is not seen but heard seems to fall down a trap door hes planted in an escape tunnel it is really tedious after awhile to see the professor always fall in these films one turns to the gene wilder comedy admittedly a comedy sherlock holmes smarter brother wherein leo mckern is a wonderfully wacky and villainous moriarty complete finally with an irish accent who is not killed at the end but just left mulling  in a rowboat  over how his careful schemes did not work out i rather liked that betterbr br the use of the dancing men code here like the use of the devils foot root in dressed to kill snags a part of a mystery from a short story the adventure of the dancing men appeared in the return of sherlock holmes and deals with a client of holmes whose wife has been getting weird bloodcurdling messages in this code charles higham in his biography the adventures of conan doyle suggests sir arthur may have picked up the code from a magazine game in the s but we really dont know the code is basically one of letter substitutions for the figures of the dancing men the story in the short story is dramatic but deals with a triangle the only innovation in the film is that tobel makes a slight change that confuses both holmes and moriarty br br the film will entertain but i still think the house of fear the scarlet claw and sherlock holmes faces death are better films
