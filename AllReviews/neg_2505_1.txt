NEG first off i refuse to even consider this piece of work a music video i consider it a short film that uses excerpts of the song thriller in its soundtrack to me a music video must be no longer than the song itself and the song must play the entire length of the video calling this a music video is like calling the great gatsby a poem on top of this lets face it thriller is a boring  minutes including the extremely dated werewolf transformation the mindless vincent price poem just because vp recites it doesnt mean its not lame and the least threatening zombies i have ever seen sure this was certainly a cultural phenomenon but dont forget this also happened at the same time the ateam was the  show on tv so lets not give the culture too much credit on that one one last point on this films impact on the media on music videos what exactly did this add to the equation that billie jean and beat it didnt already add from what i can tell it only added the practice of stopping the song for some dialog or a superfluous dance scene so you could say that all this video really did was give puffy the inspiration to make more annoying music videos not quite my definition of great
