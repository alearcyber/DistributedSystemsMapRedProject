NEG i saw this movie today on the big screen and i can honestly not believe some of the comments made by people on here i was really hoping to be touched by this film but wasntbr br im ex australian army and very patriotic towards this great country but i feel this movie no way does justice for us and those soldier who fought at this battlebr br the movie is poorly filmed i thought the acting was terrible they were not believable and they didnt give me any reason for me to care about them people are saying this movie was graphic there were a couple of graphic scenes but i found most part very weak the war scenes were very short and only last a couple of minutesbr br overall a weak film that doesnt do these soldiers any justice
