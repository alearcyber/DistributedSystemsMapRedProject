NEG this review does not necessarily expose the plot of the movie however it may change ones expectations of the movie and thus make for a less enjoyable experience br br ever rented a scary movie expecting to be on the edge of your seat in fear and instead ended up howling in laughter at each and every stupid turn of the plot this movie had so many opportunities to impress and actually scare the viewer it was cut poorly and jumped around too much making references to the past seem more like excuses as to why the plot was heading in its particular direction the writers must not have thought about how the potentially excellent plot should have been carried out because the poor construction of time throughout the plot is discouraging to the viewer and makes the movie increasingly tiring to watchbr br almost worse than the writers having abused what could have been an excellent and classic thriller was the fact that it gradually relied on cheap tactics for a scare the acting didnt make it scary and the situations hardly made it scary therefore it needed a few dark scenes with things jumping out at you to make it worthwhile even those were predictablebr br not even the gore couldve saved the plot and it rivals the gore of the successful thriller seenbr br speaking of seen i feel like saw tried to follow seens incredibly fascinating psychological theme but failed miserably in doing so i was terribly disappointed in the lack of analysis and plot structure surrounding the psychology of the killer the beginning scenes tease the viewer into thinking that this is a psychological thriller believe me it is far from thatbr br oh did i mention poor acting at first cary elwes seems makes a convincing performance however this completely deteriorates at the most crucial parts of the plot i was left in tears of laughter at this performance which is worthy of a razzie the performance of leigh whannell is also terrible and too playedout although not as bad as the performance by elwes and the big red flag with this is that whannell is also a writer for the moviebr br the end of saw could never make up for having lost the entire middle of it and that is what makes it a huge failure it was an opportunity wasted and i have no clue as to why monica potter and danny glover chose to take roles in this moviebr br i am mad at myself for wasting money on just renting it it was definitely not worth the  and in the future i will definitely avoid seeing anything having to do with elwes whannell or james wan the big tragedy in this is not that it lacked basis to its plot its that the great potential storyline was thrown away and poor acting added insult to injury ill avoid the poor puns involving the title and just conclude with this dont watch this movie
