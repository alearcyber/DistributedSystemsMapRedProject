POS the film is really good it doesnt use violence or sex etc to sell itself like other films but instead just uses a really decent plotbased on the original by michael caine and some great actors to make a fun action packed film which i thoroughly enjoyed one thing which made me enjoy this film even more was that it had some actors which i really like such as edward nortonwho i last saw in th hour which i enjoyed also jason stathamtransporter enjoyed that also and seth green who i think is great his role as shawn fannings roommate dubbed the napster is hilarious and his hacking skills play a great part in the main heist which centres around a large traffic jam in la the car chases are really decent and the high tech equipment used by the thieves is interesting and very impressive i havent seen the original so i cant really compare the too but i liked this a lot and would highly recommend this film to everyone it isnt a film where you need to like that specific genre it will suit everyone i felt good after this movie it had a really good ending and was overall really fun to watch i give it  go watch it
