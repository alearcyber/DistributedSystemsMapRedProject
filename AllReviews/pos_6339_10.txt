POS excellent episode showed dean has not only good taste by picking cassie for his girlfriend but also shows he does have a heart and can love just one woman and hes not just some guy who loves and leaves em aweso e episode applaud them on this one i only hope that some way they go back to the cassie relationship next season if there is a next season i would like to see her come back into their supernatural lives especially deans also i like the fact the chose an africanamerican woman to be the special lady in his life that got away somehow i hope they dont screw that up and end it as he episdoe ended the girl who played cassie was truly a looker and it was good to see the wb branching out into what we all see in everyday lifethe interacial coupling that has become common and acceptablefinally
