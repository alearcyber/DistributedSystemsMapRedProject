NEG there were some decent moments in this film and a couple of times where it was pretty funny however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by there was better chemistry between him and liv tyler in armageddon hell there was better chemistry between sly and sandra in demolition manbr br there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow movingbr br this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding wait until its been out for a year and a half on video and rent it in the  cent bin if youve got nothing else to do on a rainy sunday afternoon and you cant think of any better movies to rent
