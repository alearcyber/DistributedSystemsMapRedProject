NEG bythenumbers oscarhungry biopic about the late great singer ray charles there is one  exactly one  great scene in ray it occurs during a flashback to charles youth after the boy become completely blind running into the sharecropper house which he shares with his mother he trips over a chair and sprawls on the floor he cries out for his mother she in keeping with her philosophy that a person should stand on their own two feet observes silently and pensively from the kitchen waiting to see if the boy can fall back on his own resources the boy proves to be up to the challenge using his ears and memory to locate a kettle on a stove a nearby firepit the grass blowing in the wind outside of a window the scuttling of a cricket across the plankboard floorbr br the movie pauses here it expands it breathes  even if for only  seconds the scene is a muchneeded respite from taylor hackfords otherwise noisy film by noisy im not referring to the music which is of course excellent i am referring to the sound effects big booms preceding yet another flashback and the inane dialog im speaking to you as a friend ray etc on the visual side hackford is equally and pointlessly flashy sepiacolored filters over the camera lenses during the flashbacks whirlingdervish s from the cameracrane etc etc all the modern amenities what a horrible cinematic style is displayed in ray  a style alltoocommon in wannabe important movies from the past decade or so scorseses aviator is stylistically very similar to this movie these gimmicks are employed to obfuscate the clichridden screenplay some of us wont be fooledbr br some of us also are not quite prepared to accept jamie foxxs performance as anything more than superb mimicry granted foxx eerily resembles ray charles he walks like charles talks like charles and even twitches like charles foxxs imitation of the singer during live performance is technically perfect im not begrudging mr foxx his oscar he deserved it it was a pretty weak field this year anyway but one wonders if foxx really understands charles the actor does achieve one great moment when he insists on trying out the smack that his bandmates are shooting up he registers if only for a brief moment a disgust at the unfairness of being blind and a life of darkness the movie seems to want to dramatize the struggle within charles between the bright salvation of music and the oblivion of heroin with his blindness as the battleground between those two compulsions but the damn movie just wont take the time it bounces along from triumph to triumph never really pausing for any insight into the man one has to stretch to find the dramatic tension one must supply the drama for the movie one must in other words imagine a better movie than this onebr br in its rush toward a glorious conclusion ray introduces then dodges several excellent ideas for a movie his early days on the chitlin circuit his bold musical innovations for the atlantic label the problem of his addiction to heroin the inevitable artistic compromises attendant upon overwhelming success the mans importance to the civil rights struggle touched on in the movie for oh about  minutes of screentime and much more the filmmakers are too lazy to focus on any one of these elements twoandahalf hours of watching a man overcome one adversity after another may make us feel good but such a movie is not necessarily a grand work of art this sort of approach certainly provides no deeper insight into the films subject  and shouldnt insight be the real goal of a movie like this if i had wanted a laundrylist of ray charles accomplishments id have simply googled himbr br  stars out of   the extra  stars strictly for the music
