NEG the wizard of menlo park was deeply responsible for many things we take for granted in  even if he did not invent them without rivals or assistants he gave birth to the electric light the phonograph the motion picture camera the electric car battery the electric power grid possibly his most important but least recalled invention the prefabricated house and innovations to the telephone and telegraph as well as the tickertape machine and an early voting machine the total number of patents is over   far more than any other american inventorbr br but edison was a ruthless business competitor he frequently had vast legal fights over the precedence of his inventions over rivals the best example is the telephone where he was one of seven or eight rivals with claims against alexander graham bell actually edisons invention here was not the central idea that bell and gray had come up with independently of each other in  but an improvement on the sound quality of the phone receiver and transmitter that bell did not develop still it was part of the huge  supreme court decision that was the longest us supreme court decision a single volume of their reports written by chief justice morrison waite  which by the way killed the poor chief justice from overwork within weeks of completing itbr br in  edison found an equally ruthless competitor in the area of electric power grids for large cities this was george westinghouse inventor of the railroad air break westinghouses firm had gotten the assistance of a new inventor and former edison assistant nicola tesla tesla developed alternating current which was a rival system to edisons direct current edisons system was basically a straight circuit system of electricity teslas system allowed the current to be switched from one circuit to another  actually it was a better and more efficient system but edison was determined to break this rival by a publicity campaignbr br it started with electric power lines edison early on had his lines put underground so that they would not be endangered by weather conditions but westinghouse was forced to have his lines out in the open  like telephone lines when there were several accidental deaths by repair linemen on westinghouses lines in particular one incident where the repairman was burned alive in front of hundreds of horrified onlookers in manhattans business district edison started insisting that ac current was far more dangerous that dcbr br one result of all this was edison helping some subsidiary inventors with getting westinghouse ac generators and dynamos for an electric chair edison himself always denied that he invented the electric chair but he helped several lesser figures along the way  for the complete story read mark essigs edison  the electric chair new york walker  company  br br edison experiment himself with cats and dogs experiments he was glad to show the public in the long run despite assisting in the invention of a new method of execution edison failed to dislodge the public support of alternating current but he never stopped tryingbr br in  he had an opportunity to combine his campaign against westinghouse and ac with his invention of the motion picture camera he assisted in putting down a well known public elephant topsy who had killed several men he did so by electrocuting the poor beast with ac but the entire killing is on film  and one can view it to this day it is a pitiful looking film  whatever poor topsy had done it was a poor beast  not a machiavellian murderer the moment we see the explosions of electricity sparks that show the death of the elephant we are aware it will soon be over but the sudden collapse of topsy is still an unpleasant sight to view the film leaves a bad flavor in the mouths of modern movie audiences yet sad to say it probably made a profit for edison  his description of the film in his catalog of films shows real pride in his accomplishment here in  it may have been exciting entertainment for many americans watching it one is glad that more people are appalled by it today  sometimes one can sense the human race has improved a little bit
