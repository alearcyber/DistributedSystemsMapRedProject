POS despite its pedigree the most interesting things about this series are not the animatronics or puppetry which while charming are little more than sideshows at least in the story i saw a story short in fact loathe though i am to admit it the programmes chief pleasure lies in that most ancient art storytellingbr br john hurt in rowley birken qcmode grotesque medieval makeup relates a story about story telling seated by the fire accompanied by a cynical dog one winters day starving and poor he spots a fellow beggar thrown out of the royal kitchen by the nasty cook the story teller tricks this latter into giving them an excellent soup furious the cook pleads with the king for permission to boil the villain but pleased with the story tellers wit the monarch offers him a reprieve  for  nights he must tell the king a new story if he fails to do so he will hand him over to the cookbr br the story may be old but its told with great gusto anthony minghellas script is excellently dramatic as befits a playwright witty and with some disturbing concerns beneath the fun such as fears for the self or the culturally selfgenerating power of storytelling linked to the continuation of ideological power for a programme aimed at children it is bracingly selfreflexive with little nonsense about film being the new oral culture despite the americanised style there is a charming sense of medieval bustle its grotesqueness and arbitrary terror as well as its magic and power
