POS thank you mario van peebles for informing us of not only the existence of black cowboys but providing a compelling story that was easy to followbr br the plot backdrop music and talent were all top notch it was great that you used so many africanamerican artists to tell the tale of the black cowboy it was also good to see billy zane in this movie does he ever play a good guybr br i would highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to broaden their way of thinking this is an excellent movie and i feel privileged to have seen it hopefully youll feel the same
