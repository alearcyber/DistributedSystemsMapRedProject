NEG i know most of the other reviews say that this movie was great but i have to disagreebr br sure its a good book it was actually one of my favorites when i was verrry little but its just not meant for theaters maybe for a little halfhour short but i dont see how they can turn a short kiddie book into a whole feature filmbr br it is a cute movie but i would only recommend it for really little kids older kids will have no interest it adults may have a little more interest if they watch it with their young ones but anyone ages adult will have a snorefestbr br sorry if you disagree with me but this is my opinion
