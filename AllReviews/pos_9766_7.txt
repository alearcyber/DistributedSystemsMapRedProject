POS i raced to the library to check out this miniseries after having just finished listening to the marvelous talking books unabridged version of the book the first half of this tv version is really very good but it stumbles quite a bit in the second half the relationship with the trustee is overplayed and conflicts are inserted between jean and joe that dont exist in shutes story unwisely in my opinion as they greatly diminish the power of their love story i was disappointed to find that the wonderful bryan browns joe seemed a lot cockier and much less appealing than the man in the book but helen morses jean was really quite good i think they would have had to make this a hour miniseries to develop the outback story properly but all that said i did watch whole thing in more or less one go and did appreciate its merits all the while wishing that someone would do a less soapy remake
