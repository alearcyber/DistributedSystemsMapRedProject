POS this is a docudrama of mostly the later years of kws life with nearly all the parts played by actors but spot which tv quartermaster plays himself it was made for the bbc arts channel but my guess is there will be syndication and dvd releases soon kw is ably played by the excellent michael sheen here repeating his previous stage role with great success most of the supporting cast are also very good and a nice touch is the recreation of period tv appearances with the new actors this is not however light viewing  anyone familiar with kws diaries and general unhappy demeanour will already know how twisted he could be in later life  so dont expect  minutes of carry on styled buffoonery since the emphasis is decidedly downbeat throughout recommended but its tragicomic indeed
