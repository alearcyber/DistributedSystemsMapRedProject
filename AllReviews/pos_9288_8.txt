POS a very funny look at some of australias current affairs and political goingson the chaser boys really seem to have fun with this show and what i enjoy is that they all have their strengths some are brilliant chas at making complete idiots of themselves whereas julian can pull off the whole im interviewing a famous politician and im about to suggest that he disguise himself as a pot of jam type of humourbr br they have great segments in the show taking the mick out of all sorts of aspects of australian culture such as our current affairs shows our adverts and early morning tv programmes some material is a bit tired and predictable but overall its a lot of fun to watch and will leave you with a smile on your face
