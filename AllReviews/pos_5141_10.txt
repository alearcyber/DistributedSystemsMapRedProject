POS i took my younger niece to an early showing and she loved it i enjoyed it myself as well i dont need to explain the plot since the movie remains completely true to the awardwinning topselling book by famed author carl hiaasen the movie takes the popular book and layers it with beautiful cinematography i want to go to florida now humor thanks to funnyman luke wilson and some newcomers and great music i have to get to get a jimmy buffet cd now i know a movie is good when i get goosebumps in the end overall it was great family film that i felt comfortable taking my younger niece to id recommend it to any and everyone
