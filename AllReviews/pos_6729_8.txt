POS i remember watching this as a child as part of the childrens film foundations friday film specials on cbbc and have recently happened upon a copybr br in the twenty or so years since my last viewing this film has lost nothingbr br it is an atmospheric tale which entices with cornish folklore and adds elements of truly creepy imagery of the ghost of the young miner billybr br shot in the wonderfully scenic port loe area of cornwall the film utilises the mixture of rugged coastline and abandoned tin mines to make the setting truly believablebr br there is much packed into this cff drama something long since lost from childrens television today and well worth a look if you can track down a copy
