POS i am a long time fan of luc bessons work and for about as long as ive known his name ive also looked for this movie i tried looking for this movie all over california for over four years this past summer i took a trip to europe one of my missions on this trip was to at least see this movie long story short i bought it and watched it in france i was blown away it completely made my trip and i finally feel content that i have seen luc bessons first work absolutely amazing character development very thought provoking great acting and the ultimate concept movie if you are a concept movie fan this is one of the most original and classic i feel as though it is a rare treat to see a movie like this one its risky its unorthodox and ultimately its just downright unique if you are a luc besson fan its indeed a must see however whether your a besson fan or not its definitely an important work overall a great contribution to the immortal art of cinema
