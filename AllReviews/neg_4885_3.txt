NEG i am testing myself to watch  bad movies in a row to find out if watching  bad movies in a row could give me amnesia i have a dubbed to english version of this movie now let me go down the points music score bad quality but at least it suits story its about a guy who goes to a town and he meets his sheriff brother and they fight for farmers land from a major and he allies with mexicans to drive them out and trinity and his brother try to teach them to defend it  the final climatic fight scene will confuse anyone about who the  are the good guys conclusion better than i thought but i need to continue with this i am next going to watch the dolph lungren and jeanclaudde vanne damme movie universal soldier pray for my sanity
