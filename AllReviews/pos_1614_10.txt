POS i first saw death in venice  about  years ago found it profoundly moving and often thought about it watching it again few days ago i realized that it is close to the top of the great works of cinema with hardly any dialog it captivates a viewer with the beautiful cinematography the fine acting and above all the mahlers music without which the movie simply could not existbr br death in venice is a stunning luchino viscontis adaptation of the thomas mann novella about a famous composer in the novella he was a writer but making him a composer in a movie was a great idea that works admirably gustav von aschenbach loosely based on gustav mahler who travels to venice in the summer of  to recover from personal losses and professional failures his search for beauty and perfection seems to be completed when he sees a boy of incredible divine beauty ashenbach dirk bogard follows the boy everywhere never trying to approach him the boy tadzio belonged to very rare creatures that own an enigmatic and inconceivable power which captivates you enchants you conquers you and makes you its prisoner ashenbach became one of the prisoners of tadzio spellbinding charms he became addicted to him he fell in love with him was it bless or curse for him i think both he died from unreachable impossible yet beautiful love which object was perfection itself the last image ashenbachs eyes captured was that of the boys silhouette surrounded by the sea and golden sun light nothing could compare to the beauty and charm of the scene and to take it with you to the grave is the death one can only dream about if he could ashenbach probably wouldve said i was able to witness one of the faces of perfection i could not bear it but i was chosen to learn that it exists here in this world and i can die in peace now because it did happen to me br br unforgettable music gustav mahlers haunting adagietto of his fifth symphony found perfect use in a perfect movie it reflects every emotion of a main character  it sobs it longs it begs for hope and it summarizes the idea that once you are blessed to encounter beauty you are condemned to die i may come up with hundreds movies that use classical music to perfection but nothing will ever compare to death in venice i dare say that mahlers music is its main character  it would change and sound differently depending on what was happening on the screen it sounded triumphantly when ashenbach returned back to venice to what he thought would be his happiness but turned to be his death it sounded gloomy when he first entered venice from the sea you can hear so many different feelings in it  tenderness and adoration confusion and selfloathing worship and melancholy but always  love that gives the purest happiness and breaks the hearts literally the movie for a viewer is similar to what the boy was for the aging composerwriterartist we are enchanted and captivated by its power and beauty as much as achenbach was by the boys mysterious charm
