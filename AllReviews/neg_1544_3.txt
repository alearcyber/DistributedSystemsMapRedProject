NEG hard to believe that director barbet schroeder once did the majestic and very funny maitresse  and now only seems to do by the numbers hollywood thrillersbr br this is very lightweight john grisham material crossed with the plot of a tv movie bullock is cass mayweather a feisty and independent crime investigator specialising in serial killers ben chaplin is her reserved police partner sam kennedy and together they make an uncomfortable duo not good when two unbalanced college maladriots gosling and pitt decide to send them on a wild goose chase  by planting very clever and misleading forensic evidence at a crime scenebr br fair enough but while bullock and chaplin fail to create any sparks we also have to endure a several dull overlymelodramatic flashbacks illustrating an important event in casss history then of course there are the frequent shots of a cliffside log cabin where theres absolutely no doubt the ott ending will be set oooh the atmospherebr br watch any episode of csi instead its to the point and far more exciting
