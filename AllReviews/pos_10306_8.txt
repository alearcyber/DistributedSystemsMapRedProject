POS i agree with andy this is a good movie kevin mckidds character is believable throughout the film were forced to hate him and latterly sympathise with him paula sage who plays roberta puts in a good performance too its thoughtprovoking and emotive without any slush overproduction credit to director alison peebles and writer andrea gibb for that a very worthwhile viewing the pace of the film is just right raising just enough interest in the subject matter to reel you in rather than bombard you with facts in a documentary style nice little soundtrack to go with the film too again used sparingly not to distract you from storyline recommended
