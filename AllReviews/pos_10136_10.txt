POS this is one of the best films i have ever seen how anyone can knock this movie just befuddles my imagination first of all goodings and harriss performances were simply spectacular especially gooding that is the only way i can describe the acting spectacular you have to imagine how difficult it would be to play a character like that and pull it off then you see gooding and his performance was magical as for the plot since it was based on a true person it goes where the lives of the characters go for all the action buffs it might be a little slow but then its not an action film i definitely give this movie a  it deserves nothing less
