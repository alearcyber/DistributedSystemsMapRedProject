NEG no serious spoilers but some very minor onesbr br acacia a korean contribution to the ever popular asian horror wave concerns a husband and wife who decide that theyre getting on a bit and decide to adopt a child the child who has an usual obsession with the dead tree in the familys garden eventually disappears when the couple eventually have a child of their own and the aforementioned tree seems to hold a grudge against the family itselfbr br and thats about it the film moves at a snails pace clocking in at over  minutes with  minute material it is essentially a thin family drama with a creepy tree and there is very little in the way of scares just shots of the tree with weird mumbling noises playing over the top however the idea of the tree being the childs mother is a pretty original one but it isnt exactly exploited to its full potential this sort of separates acacia from much of the new wave it belongs to films like juon and ring tend to do the opposite and milk bland ideas until they are red in the facebr br the film does begin to get going towards the end however the realisation of the childs fate and the parents actions not only dampen the earlier curiosity of the story but are revealed with such machine gun editing that its difficult to take in all at once the final sequence is undoubtedly creepy however it feels like too little too latebr br overall the film does not feel too much like a ring cash in however with the film renaissance that korea is currently going through i couldnt help but feel this film could have been so much more
