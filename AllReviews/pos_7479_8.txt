POS is thursday an original film heck no but it is a lot of fun i just caught this buried on the movie channels one night and it was an enjoyable flick i was expecting much but what i got was some interesting scenes i really liked the first seen at the convenience store some amusing stories as told by the characters and a little bit of action thrown in the mix as well some good performances from young actors paulina porizkova was good and i was particularly impressed with aaron eckhart who has gone on to impress me further in yours friends and neighbours and erin brokovich so if you want  minutes of easy going fun go ahead and check out thursday
