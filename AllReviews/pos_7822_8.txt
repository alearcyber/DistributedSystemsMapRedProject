POS this is a great valentines day gift a gorgeous guy and a pretty girl fall in love while trying to beat the competition at a baking contest very romantic im a real fan of costas mandylor since his days at picket fences and he hasnt lost his appeal lauren holly is still lovely and adorable and the two still have great chemistry together the supporting cast was good as well seeing all those wonderful desserts being made was a delicious sight in itself i loved that costas and lauren teamed up to win in the baking competition and in love this is the kind of film that satifies all palates romantic and otherwise hallmark always shows excellence in their programming and this is no exception the whole family can view this film also shows that sometimes love triumphs over any adversity i found myself sighing and wishing for more for this film and also yearning for those wonderful desserts i recommend this film highly for all ages a great treat for all
