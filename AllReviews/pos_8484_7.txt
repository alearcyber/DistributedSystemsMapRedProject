POS ray is interesting in parts and technically its very well made but ray is often sluggish and forgets some important details about rays life all the movie shows us is parts where hes in his prime and most successful which is good its just i wanted to see some bits about his older life too jamie fox mimics ray charles to a t at times its absolutely uncanny i have to say jamie is the reason i got through this movie the st half is a lot better then the nd its more interesting it has more oomph and its nowhere near as sluggish as the nd i wasnt a big fan of ray charles to begin with to be honest so i really didnt have any expectations for the film what so ever rays biggest problem had to be the over length this couldve been cut very easily with more relevant scenes other then the ones they used i found the early part of rays life when he was just starting to get successful the most interesting he was humble back then and somewhat a gentleman and while the film may have over exaggerated his actions he got a bit too full of himself for me to carebr br performance jamie fox gives a performance for the ages as ray he looks like ray talks like ray acts like ray he even sings like ray this is much more then an impression i truly believed he was ray charles he was the heart of the film and without his presence this film wouldve been a complete and utter borebr br bottom line ray is interesting at times dreadfully dull at others when all was said and done i was disappointed by how routine it seemed at times just because its a bibliographical film doesent mean its automatically oscar worthy jamie fox deserved his oscar but the movie is above average at best worth a watch but if i were you id keep my expectations at a rather comfortable levelbr br
