NEG im sorry but i dont understand how the studio gets away with this the movie is just not worth it maybe as a theaterplay but certainly not as a movie and why do they call it a thriller offcource the acting is good but i didnt expect anything less from these perfect actors robert redford plays very well and willem dafoe is convincing enough as the softy bad guy helen mirren can play almost any role and always still looks beautiful to me  im also a fan of her british detectives still they just cant save this ow so boring movie im sorry i hope we dont get to many movies anymore from this director pieter jan brugge cause he obviously doesnt now the meaning of the words suspence and thriller
