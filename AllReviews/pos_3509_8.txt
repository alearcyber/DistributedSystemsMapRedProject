POS the cover of the vhs says it all without doubt the most powerful movie of its kind since the texas chainsaw massacre im a huge fan of s and s slashers and i have to say i agree   the characters are believable the actors have an excellent charm especially george kennedy as the forestranger theres the twisted atmosphere that only tcm has an astounding soundtrack to reflect the emotions and the filming locations that are the most beautiful in the history of horror this has to be one of the most beautifully shot horror films of all time jeff lieberman as a director of this  low budget film does and excellent job and with his other works blue sunshine wrong turn added he must be one of the most underrated directors in the filmindustry today
