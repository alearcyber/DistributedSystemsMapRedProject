NEG i really enjoyed candid camera with dom deluise and i was surprised to see that after the years suzanne somers have becomed the costar of the show but that was the only positive side of the show  the whole studio the intro the hosts  all that give the new meaning to the word pompousbr br well that would be ok if the materials werent so crppy  i mean come on the best you can do is show few men that have problem with getting ketchup out of the bottle suzanne somers walking with halloween basket in july ice cream place that sells only vanilla ive seen few episodes and each time it was horrible they were posing like its the greatest show ever and then fill the time with scenes so dull that i really felt embarrassed to watch even the people in them looked bored and that just cant be good
