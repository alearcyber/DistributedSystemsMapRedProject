NEG this movie is at times a wild s college sex comedy others a sweet romantic one then it has moments of serious drama and then sprinkles in dashes of science fiction it is so uneven its almost ridiculousbr br but i would hardly rank it as one of the worst films ive ever seen except of course for the fact that they casted peter otoolebr br there is absolutely nothing for him to work with here poor dialog poor performances to work off of poor everything and yet hes fantastic there is not one good thing about his part and yet he makes it work if only on pure charm alonebr br the fact that he was so able to achieve so much with so little shines a spotlight on how greatly everyone else in this film failed making it seem even worse than i suppose it actually isbr br if any other actor was in otooles role i would have forgotten this movie as crap and never thought of it again but a fine performance by peter otoole despite all odds ensures that ill remember this film for a long time to come if only as a film that maybe could have been good if anyone involved in it was nearly half as good as peter otoole
