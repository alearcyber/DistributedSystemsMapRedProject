POS i didnt know a lot about this film going into it but i did find out that kane was a wrestler which didnt exactly thrill me but hey i liked santas slay and that had a wrestler in it so what the hell the story begins very strangely and promisingly but after a while becomes not much more than your typical teen terror slasher flick although the settings helped some a bunch of criminal young folks get rounded up and taken to an old hotel that used to be a luxury palace but is now a dump to clean it up to prepare it as a homeless shelter the driver is a man with a prosthetic arm being a veteran of the opening scene of this movie wherein he encounters this big galoot that had just killed his partner and blinded another woman the teens all being punk smartasses all of course object to having to do any real work but theyre part of some unique coed work program yep what a great idea that is of course little does anyone suspect that there is someone lurking there in the hotel that in his own little way will save the tax payers of that state some money of course its the guy that likes to collect eyeballs and hes got quite a collection going there wont be a lot here that horror fans havent seen before but theres a few brutal scenes and sufficient gore to satisfy the hardcore fan the setting of the old hotel makes a perfect spot for a slasher flick too and theres little substories like the search for an alleged safe full of money and the search for babes since this coed work crew is evenly matched most of the teens are deservingly killable too so that works well not great but far better than silent hill or when a stranger calls and perhaps better than some of the other crap that i wouldnt bother to see  out of
