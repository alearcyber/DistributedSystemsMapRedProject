POS i just saw this movie for the second time with my yearold daughter and i remembered why we liked it the first time all these people who say it is bad are too uptight and critical it is simply an entertaining little movie its not supposed to change the world i thought all the actors did a great job with their characters except for jeremy jordan as guyhe was a maggot who looked seriously in need of soap and shampoo if he is supposed to be the hot guy in their school then theyve got slim pickins but i digressdrew barrymore was delightful as usual and david arquette was even enjoyable and i usually cant stomach him if only because of those stupid att commercials molly shannon is always entertaining and leelee sobieski did a great job as a tortured brain some parts were actually painful to watch reminding me of high school even though i thankfully didnt get made fun of it made my heart ache for those who do movies like this are actually good for children to seemy daughter made several observations about the cruelty of some of the students and how wrong it was this movie is appropriate for anyone and a good way to while away  hours if theres ever a time you want to see a lighthearted little movie with a happy ending where you dont have to think very much then this is definitely a consideration
