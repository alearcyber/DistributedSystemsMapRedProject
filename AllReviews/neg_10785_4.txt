NEG i cant believe some of the scores this film is getting on the imdb website have i been issued with the special edition naff version edited by dewhurst produced by bernard matthews this film should be housed in battersea im sorry for all the ukcentric references but if youre elsewhere and youve got no toenails to cut or you havent got a beer mat collection to catalogue then this film might just be worth  mins of your remaining lifespan as long as you havent got any paint to watch drying the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted what on earth is irons doing in this film
