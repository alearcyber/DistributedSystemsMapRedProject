NEG tug is absolutely right although i am sure that mr osmond wanted to make a sincere heartwarming christmas movie this one is as cynical and creepy as they come the religious significance of christmas is forgotten and replaced with cute kids clueless grownups and dopey villains the production values demonstrate that this was either filmed on a shoestring or by truly inexperienced filmmakers i suspect the latter unfortunately the worst part oddly enough really is the music you would think someone with a longstanding musical career could do better than the title song but you would be wrong even my mom didnt like this movie and she likes the osmonds and sappy stuff
