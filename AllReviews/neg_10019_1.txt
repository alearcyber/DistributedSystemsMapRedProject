NEG this is truly without exaggerating one of the worst slasher movies ever made i know it came out in the s following a tendency started by friday the th the prey copies the forementioned movie in many aspects the woods setting the killer the dumb teens the gore etcbr br but the prey is as bad as you might expect i didnt even remember about it if it wasnt for coincidencebr br well the killer is in fact human so dont expect a supernatural killer in the likes of jason the situations rather boring and lack of tension gore violence etc it just does not works for a slasher flickbr br the acting is simply horrid the score is horrible a combination of boring instruments with cheesy s tunes i wont even mention the technical aspects of the movie because believe me it seems that it cost only  dollarsbr br please avoid this one like the plague its one of the worst movies ive ever seen and thats something to say thank god it seems to have vanished from earth
