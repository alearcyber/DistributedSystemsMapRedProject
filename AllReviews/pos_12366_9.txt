POS not as well known as the english american german and french cinema though cinema from sweden from the s was also quite good interesting and revolutionarybr br this is a movie that is made great by its story the story is told in a christmas carol kind of way in which the death himself confronts the deceased with his past present and what could have been its of course a story that concentrates on morals and it does this very well the message comes across as very powerful and effective this is of course also definitely due to the effective directing from the father of swedish cinema victor sjstrmbr br the story is based on the novel by other swedish author selma lagerlf the story is adapted by victor sjstrm himself who perhaps should had taken out a few more elements to let the story and movie flow better it perhaps takes a bit too long before the movie starts to take form and the story gets clear but when the movie does take form and pace it becomes a really wonderful onebr br the movie does not only have a great story it also is a good looking one the movie uses some early and effective effects and uses some different color filters to create the right mood and to indicate what it past present and futurebr br sjstrm did not only wrote and directed this movie he also plays the main character of course the acting in the movie is overthetop at times by todays standards but not as bad as in for instance early german movies was the case and after all this movie is more about its story and morals than it is about the acting so it really doesnt matter much or distractsbr br a really great and effective underrated silentmovie classic from swedenbr br
