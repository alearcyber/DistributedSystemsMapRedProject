NEG considering that they wanted to do a vampire movie in space i thought well itll probably be pretty cheesy but at least interesting enough to see a different take on the whole genre whoops i dont care what kind of movies you like even if youre the biggest vampire horror thriller or suspense fan in the world or adversely if youve never seen a horror movie before and would expect that your first would be impressive in any way whatsoeveryoure wrong i dont think ive ever seen a made for tv movie or afterschool special this bad ive never seen a tv pilot show this bad ive never seen footage of animals sleeping or shitting thats as bad as this this is by far the single biggest waste of hours you could otherwise spend contemplating the importance of dish towels and their effect on your life i would far rather be trapped in a bathroom for weeks with nothing to consume but my own urine and excrement than watch even a single clip of this movie again watching this made me wish for the fates that the characters fell to instead of dealing with knowing that i paid money to watch it it was however like a train wreck so bad you just couldnt help but watch hoping something good might happen it didnt please for the love of god if you or your friends  even if using illicit substances while doing so  even consider watching this movie choose instead to have a contest to see who can shoot a snotrocket farther it will bring you far greater enjoyment and entertainment
