POS watching this film caused quite an emotional reaction this is what todays documentaries are all about its refreshing to watch something so personal honest and real mr blocks thoughts opinions and disclosure are rarely seen these days and are incredibly well displayed here its a fine line to walk between personal truth and exploitation this film treads very carefully and quite successfullybr br one would think that learning about how a seemingly normal couple falls short of societys expectations would give birth to pessimismbut it doesnt quite the opposite it made me feel good i feel that i now know more about marriageabout womenbr br definitely check this out itll make you think  exactly what a good documentary should be designed to do
