POS one of the most interesting things is that this  film is highly touted as an inname only sequel theres nothing wrong with that except this the return of chevy chase as ty webb this connects the viewer to this character from the original caddyshack in  and makes fans thinking or wanting caddyshack ii to be similar to the first onebr br there are rumors that rodney dangerfield was supposed to return he carried a big part of the first film so his return would have put caddyshack  over the top jackie mason is the new rodney for this movie and does a decent job even though their comic deliveries are way different dan aykroyd was great but not in the film enough he should have been involved to the tune of how much screen time bill murray got in the first one robert stack airplane was good in the new ted knightvillian role we miss you ted danny noonan should have been back so many others could have returned to show us what happened to their characters eight years later bushwood should not have undergone the total makeover it did instead the characters involved rather than the club itself should have been the main focus like they were in the first one when you watch this film keep in mind that it isnt a major sequel and you may think its another good or bad eighties comedy fans of the first should see it but dont be shocked when the comparisons between the original and part ii are so far apart
