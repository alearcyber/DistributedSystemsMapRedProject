POS um  a serious film about troubled teens in singapore a country i have not much knowledge on but have the previous wrong impression that all the kids there are highly disciplined and controlled by their family and government well i guess i am wrong just like other cities countries they also have their troubled teens who also lead the not so surprising rebellious way of life of drugs fights bad language and  many other obvious signs of being a bad boy the surprising part of this film isnt really about how these kids running around causing themselves and others trouble but rather the subtle gayness hidden behind their so call loyalty between them the bond between these brothers may very well originated from an unconscious gay tendency inside these boys though it isnt uncommon for str guys to have very close friendship with each other but watch this film closely it should be entering all sorts of gay film festivals and i would not be surprised that it may win itself a lot more awards toward this direction
