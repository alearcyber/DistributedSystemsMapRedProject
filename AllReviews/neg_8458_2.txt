NEG i used to think that it came from hollywood was the worst movie i had seen that showed clips from horror scifi crime and drama movies of course i hadnt seen this beauty yetbr br whats wrong with terror in the aisles four thingsbr br  it assumes that most of the great moments in shock cinema history began in the s when directors like john carpenter and brian de palma came along and what bones are thrown to the true classics ie  the black and white films like frankenstein dracula and the wolf man are either shown with martin and lewis or abbott and costello alongside or not at allbr br  the clips are most times so brief and out of their originals place that they just give a momentary shock to the viewer and for those unfamiliar with these films will make no sense at all indeed the moment where the shark jumps out of the water at roy scheider in jaws is shown much to the effect of a sight gag whereas in the originals context it had powerbr br  did we really need pleasance and allen in the audience reminding us that its only a movie or that most of the violence in the horror movies is sadly against women so is that an indictment against the moviemakers for adding those scenes or the moviegoers who tromp into the theaters and watch the same kind of fodder time and again sorry thats a whole can of worms to open for a more deserving moviebr br  and most importantly why is the movie so short it isnt like there wasnt enough of these kinds of movies to use if they had just opened up their resources and used every available film they could have had a thats entertainmentstyle movie that would have been comparatively more entertaining heck even drag out christopher lee and peter cushing cushing was alive then mind you and better yet even vincent price would have been more than willing ill bet what a cheer that would have gotten from the audiencebr br but no all were left with is a dreary little flick that pretends to pay homage to these movies but all it does is leave the viewer feeling cheated out of less than  minutes with which they could have went and watched a real movie dont get me wrong it was good to see what clips they did show but if they could have just done more with the goodsbr br two stars another good idea left laying in the aisles
