NEG when you first sit down to watch this movie keep in mind that you are about to see something youve probably never seen before keep in mind that this is a movie where they obviously spent insane amounts of cash on explosions and not enough on acting or anything else for that matter the crazy thing i noticed is that every character is completely overportrayed and it seems most of the time anyhow that the film had been spedup to make the characters move faster i wonder if the hong kong version was dubbed too i understand the cartoon had this but it doesnt work for liveaction it just looks odd as if the camera crew decided to act because they couldnt afford real actorsbr br the english version is horribly dubbed and the characters words do not match the mouths at all i would have preffered subtitles but since this is a kids movie and since some kids cannot read well ill let it go but there is something extremely odd about this movie its supposedly a kids movie but theres a lot of material about sex rape and stripping which isnt exactly for young western audiences in the orient they have different laws and sexuality in childrens movies is much more accepted but parents be warned there is a scene where two characters talk about rape multiple scenes where people say sex maniac and a scene where this insanely young japanese girl does a sexy dance for one of the sex maniacs and shows him her breasts who was this movie made for anywaybr br oh and the special effects are laughable you can tell the spaceshiplike things that bomb the village are cardboard cutouts or animation i wasnt sure that look unconvincing even to a kid the makers of this movie left out a lot of cool things from the cartoon simply because they couldnt budget the kind of money theyd need i didnt like how the names of all the characters were changed it made me wonder if this movie was made by the same people as dragon ball zbr br i dont really recommed this movie to anyone kids adults or dragon ball z fans its just a poor representation of the cartoon and obviously one will be able to tell that this movie was rushed and no care whatsoever was put into it i wont even get into the camerawork just wait until the end credits at the still picture that sits there for  minutes most of the shots are not framed correctly at all and the movie just seems made by amateurs grainy film quality toobr br just all around horriblebr br
