POS the bevy of box office big league stars is phenomenal in this movie william baldwin kiefer sutherland kevin bacon and julia roberts this movie was made in one of my favorite years too  i am a chicagoan and the setting in chicago was very identifiable and artistically expedited as welli liked this movie and the agitation which motivated the climax in this picture was a powerful element to the plot which was utterly sensationalbr br flatliners centers around a group of disgruntled premed students who want to be flat lined as a way of attaining some sort of societal vindication when life does not make sense it would appear very illogical to get curious about apocalyptic nightmares at the same time once their desultory curiosity has gotten the better of them there is no turning back the king of the hill so to speak is the one who vehemently shouts i will do two minutes who else is going to do that anyone want to try for two and a half ultimately all of these newly arrived and very unwelcome recriminations now have an extremely ubiquitous disposition in these re probates lives the consummation to their justified or unjustified pathos required a full  degree perspective on the issues they were agonizing over whatever purpose all of this reckless and academic chicanery serves it is definitely an original approach for asserting your personality i liked this movie  was a good year for me too things seemed to fall into place that year when i saw this movie some night in november during the year  i was very glad that i did
