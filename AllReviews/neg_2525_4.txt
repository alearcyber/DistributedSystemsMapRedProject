NEG i used to work at the company that originally put out this film vestron pictures vestron had the same problem that a lot of small independent film companies had they didnt have a lot of money to put into the production values of their films not that money alone will buy you a good film look at kevin costners waterworld for instancebr br sometimes if you have a talented person inhouse doing the acquisitions or development you can create your own new talent but at vestron there wasnt such a person and they always skimped in some crucial area in this case it was on the director and the writer which makes it pretty hard to have a decent movie even with the great ensemble cast this film hasbr br i think the basic premise of this movie was lets put a bunch of quirky characters in a room and see if anything interesting happens its an intriguing idea but not worth your time watchingbr br most vestron films ended up having a very distinctive look and feel to them my wife and i developed the ability to spot this quality even in nonvestron films many times we were even able to spot that quality from watching only the trailer or tv ad wed sit there watching the trailer or ad and afterwards wed turn to each and almost in sync wed say now thats a vestron movie this is a vestron movie
