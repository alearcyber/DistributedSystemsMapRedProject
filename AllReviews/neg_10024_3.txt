NEG uhhh  so did they even have writers for this maybe im picky but i like a little dialog with my movies and as far as slasher films go just a sliver of character development will sufficebr br unfortunately the prey provides neitherand if you think im being hyperbolic youll just have to see it for yourself scene after scene we just get actors standing around looking forlorn and awkward abandoned by any sense of a script outside of calling out each others names when they get separated in the woods natch the only instances where these people say something substantive is when one character explains the constellation orion clearly plagiarized from funk  wagnalls scintillating slasher fare no and another rehashes an old campfire tale that doesnt even have anything to do with the plot wait what is the plot at other times the prey actually has the gall to film its characters with the boom mic just far away enough so that we cant exactly hear what theyre saying so we get entire scenes wherein the actors are murmuring deliberately seriously ive seen more dialog in a silent film its as if the filmmakers sat down at a bar somewhere in rancho cucamonga in the heyday of the s slasher craze and one looked at the other and said hey i gotta really sweet idea for a gory decapitation gag lets somehow pad an entire feature around it and  well they did br br to be fair the prey probably had some sort of writer on board i mean somebody had to jot down the scene sequence and label the dailies however i am fully convinced that this film did not have an editor of any kind whatsoever there are glaring pauses boring tableaux and zero sense of pacing throughout the filmmakers dont have anything else in the script to film so they fill out the running time with exhaustive taxonomies of the flora and fauna that inhabit the forest in which our wild and crazy teens are getting sliced and diced these critters are all filmed in straightforward noontime daylight in a completely reserved fashion and with no attempt at atmospheric photography if it feels like a science film thats because it is im pretty sure this is all nature show stock footageall thats missing is a stuffy narration from some national geographic aldermanbr br more exciting footage that was graciously spared from the cutting room floor a scene in which two men discuss cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches and another scene wherein a supporting character strums away on a banjo for what feels like an entire minuteanda half a minuteandahalf thats a lot of banjoing to commit to celluloid to begin with let alone insert into the final cut of the film way to go guys brevity and concision are the real victims of this slaughterfestbr br admittedly the film picks up quite a bit of steam comparatively in the last  minutes into which much of the carnage is condensed and where a ripoff of bla bartks music for strings percussion and celesta cuts in vaudeville great jackie coogan makes a fun appearance as a tubby bumbly park ranger this was his last role if you can believe it and there are some nice gory moments including a splattery neck tearing and the aforementioned decapitation the makeup used for the killer carel struycken aka lurch from the addams family movies is also quite effective and makes him look like a strange hybrid of young jason voorhees and freddy krueger plus if you love wacky straightouttaleftfield endings you need to check out how they wrap this puppy up youll do a spit take i promisebr br usually i love films that are on this level of ineptitude but the first threequarters of the prey are just so interminably boring that they pretty much spoil the rest overall this is a largely pallid and tedious affair and while it aint all bad it should really only be seen by debilitated slasher completists why do we do this to ourselves anyway
