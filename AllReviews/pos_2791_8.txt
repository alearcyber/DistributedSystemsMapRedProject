POS i got to watch this movie in my french class as part of lets say french culture i thought the way it was filmed and the editing was real good but mostly it was entertaining especially the guy that played wendys brother also the story line was really good as well as it was believable and yet adventurous as wellbr br favorite part when william is making fun of the german guy studying and when he acts out how flies reproduce  br br my french isnt that good but with the subtitles i could pretty much get what was going on br br watch it
