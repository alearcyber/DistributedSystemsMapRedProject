POS i have to confess that i know some of those involved i was in the forerunner to the planet evil unleased however this was more than  years ago and i had since lost contact with them i happened to be watching bbc scotland news and a piece regarding scottish cinema this mentioned and showed clips from the planet and comments from its director mark stirton this prompted me to order a copy of the film on dvdbr br now to the film the level of acting writing directing and sfx is up there with some of the best around ok its not star wars but ive seen many a hollywood product that is far inferior it is very strange watching a film spoken in my local north east scotland accent but that soon passedbr br mild spoilersbr br the planet draws on several scifi classics star wars alien pitch black forbidden planet and predator a handful of the merchant crew of a deep space transport ship survive their craft being attacked and destroyed by unknown ships they escape onto a deserted desert planet one by one they are killed by invisible attackers the ships only passenger a mysterious prisoner also makes it to the planet a battle ensues as the crew fight to survivebr br the planet is a brilliant piece of scifi film making that certainly hides its limited budget well done to mark mike and all those involved i look forward to your next work
