NEG i classify this as the worst movie of all timebr br if there ever was a movie i would wish upon my enemies this would be it the plot is ridiculous there are only  characters and the coincidences between these characters just completely strain beliefbr br these factors combined to make this an extremely boring moviebr br my wife and mother walked out on the movie about  minutes in i figured that a movie this boring and slow must have some cool interesting plot twist and a was quite disappointed when nothing exciting materializedbr br i briefly considered sending the filmmakers a bill for my  hours of lost life
