POS estevez martin sheen and kathy bates are superb in this portrayal of a vietnam vet home from the war but still haunted by it bates plays a clueless mother who just wants the family to be a family sheen is terrific as the father who tries to understand what his son is going through but is too wrapped up in his principles to really empathize the setting is thanksgiving day and the relatives are coming for dinner estevez who plays the returning vet wants no part of family tradition and insists on wearing his combat fatigues to dinner explaining this is what i wore last thanksgiving the bickering and family arguments are priceless particularly the peanut brittle crisis but the ending is both gripping and terrifying it has to be seen to be appreciatedbr br overall one of the best movies ive ever seen
