NEG disclaimer during my ventures into foreign cinema i have taken a liking to a wide variety of movies that span different genres that include horror action drama comedy and romance to name a few thus i have enjoyed the thoughtful serious tone of dramas as well as the mindless popcorn fun of action films with a wide array of chinese japanese and korean movies under my belt i am confident in my ability to recognize bright spots in movies to appreciate and complement unfortunately ashes of time has nothing to recognize it is one of the worst chinese movies i have ever seenbr br to start off this overrated swordplay epic showcases the infamous slideshow action sequence throughout which is nothing more than an ultracheap and pathetic form of action choreography one simply needs to show a series of closeup pictures of grimising faces swords legs andor arms and then a dead body bravissimo you now have an action sequence for ashes of time the problem lies not only in its poor quality but also in the fact that the scenes are so chaotic and disjointed that the viewer has no idea what the hell is going onbr br the dramatic element of this film is nonexistent as it relies on the characters telling the viewer that they love someone or hate someone instead of actually developing and showing such elements on screen which renders all characters generic and colorless leaving the viewer completely indifferent to their actions in fact the storyline itself is an absolute disaster introducing way too many characters way too quickly with way too many plot devices plot complexities in films can be used very advantageously ie a tale of two sisters but ashes of time becomes exploitative trash when it does nothing more than convolute a very simple plot for no apparently good reasonbr br in fact this entire movie acts like a series of smokescreens to cover up its deficiencies horrible action choreography is covered up by slideshow tricks and chaotic camera movements nonexistent character development is covered up by the characters overtly saying how they feel and a thoughtless storyline is covered up by confusing the viewer with convolutionbr br as if this werent bad enough this movie was extremely boring seeming more like  minutes instead of the actual br br rating  a rarely given  stars
