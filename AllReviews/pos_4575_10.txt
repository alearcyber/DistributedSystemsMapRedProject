POS i was one of the few who went out of my way to see this in the theater ive thought about it frequently ever since after two dvd viewings im glad to say it held up perfectly like any great comedy i laughed more on each viewing both in anticipation of gags but also after catching things missed before br br mike judge does very well with creating insanely comedic characters and fitting them into their world so they make sense in office space the environment make the characters believable idiocracys future gives him liberty to write unbelievably dumb characters and make them work ill be waiting to see if they release a better dvd with some actual features before buying it but this movie deserves the support on dvd not offered to it at the theater
