POS i have been looking forward to the release of this dvd and its followup female prisoner scorpion s grudge song for some time i very much enjoyed the first two movies of this series after just watching this film i would have to say that this is probably my favorite of the three br br all three of these movies were directed by shunya ito what is great about them though is that even though they all feature the same lead character wonderfully played by meiko kaji they are each vastly different from the others br br the first movie female prisoner  scorpion is more or less a typical women in prison movie but the character of scorpion is very intriguing  very reminiscent of the antiheroes of many spaghetti westerns and the director often used some very interesting and unusual visual approaches to the material br br the second movie female convict scorpion jailhouse  is a real tourdeforce not so much a wip movie as the bulk of the film has scorpion and six other escaped inmates on the lam br br this movie female prisoner scorpion beast stable is the third in the series and the last one directed by shunya ito this one plays out as much more of a crime drama once again our heroine is on the run but this time out she has managed to maintain a certain amount of normalcy in her life relatively speaking anyway she gets a job she finds a place to live she makes a friend on the outside but of course everything has to unravel eventually fps beast stable has a more straightforward story that is told at a more leisurely pace than its predecessors but i found it to be engaging from beginning to end and dont worry there is still plenty of depravity to go around in this movie but i think these movies transcend most exploitation films because the more disturbing elements are played in a straighter tone rather than being used exclusively for inyourface shock value yes there were definitely moments in this movie where i cringed mightily but i didnt feel that they detracted from the value of the story well maybe a time or two one thing i have greatly enjoyed about these films is the continued buildup of scorpions mythos with this entry character development is used much more extensively than in the previous two we get to see that she is much more than just a stonehearted vengeful badassbr br as i mentioned earlier in this review a fourth movie followed it also features meiko kaji as scorpion but had a different director without giving anything away i want to mention that fps beast stable ends in such a way as to make a sequel completely unnecessary the fourth film is still quite good but it seems to play as a superfluous footnote to a mindblowing trilogybr br i would highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in outoftheordinary films fps beast stable can be enjoyed as a standalone piece as can the first two movies but i would also recommend watching the others first if you have not already done so
