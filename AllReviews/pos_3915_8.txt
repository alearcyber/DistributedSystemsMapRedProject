POS i saw this movie on its opening night and enjoyed it i probably would have enjoyed it more if i hadnt been sitting by my father my father saw the original unfortunately i have not seen it yet and kept talking through the whole thing he kept saying that the movie sucked and that it was stupid the thing is he didnt understand that the creators were slightly making fun of the horror genre with the film in every horror movie there is always a certain character depicted if they werent in the movie well you might not really like it too much the trademark characters arebr br the lead character carly elisha cuthbert the lead characters boyfriend wade jared padalecki the lead characters siblingsoontobereformed jerk nick chad michael murray the annoying sluttish character paige paris hilton characters who are just around to look pretty dalton jon abrahams  blake robert richardbr br with those characters it makes it slightly predictable who will die and who will live obviously you know who will with what i just typed the movie may be predictable in fact i had a pretty good idea who would die just by watching the trailer but it was still enjoyable it may seem stupid why is there a sugar mill in the middle of a deserted campsite that wasnt there in the beginning at times but it is very easy to watch the comedy and gore were the perfect amount for weakstomached moviegoers it does get gory dont get me wrong less than final destination  but it works very well so in conclusion this movie wasnt as hot as the fire the set went up in but the temperature could still burn the wax
