NEG reading through most of the other reviews i tend to agree with most of the comments the one thing that i would add is the disjointed way the movie has been directed and produced i think that some of these new wave movie makers think that they are being clever using unusual sometimes jerky camera angles and flitting from one scene to another it goes down well with these movie festivals and with some of these indie type critics but it spoils the movie for me i noticed in the reviews one comment saying that none of this movie makers films have become blockbusters this would maybe prove my point as the film has that rushed to finish feeling that makes you wonder why such a beautiful film appears to be lacking a smooth flow as for the comment about kiefer sutherland being a big name to put on the poster i would bet he cringed when watching the final cut this is a story with real potential spoilt by trying to be different in its production worth watching but not many would come back for a second view
