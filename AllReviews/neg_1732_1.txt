NEG it was funny because the whole thing was so unrealistic i mean come on like a pop star would just show up at a public high school and fall in love with the girl who happens to be obsessed with him come on peoplebr br everyone but the lead girl were completely horrendous at acting the dialog was cheesy the premise was stupid and the camera work was poorly done i felt like i was watching a badly made home video br br i feel as if ive wasted almost  hours of my life that i will never get back br br i dont have anything else to say except that id rather punch myself in the face multiple times than watch this movie again
