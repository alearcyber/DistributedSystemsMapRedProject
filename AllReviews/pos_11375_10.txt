POS this film is a masterpiece it was exhilarating from beginning to end writerdirector paul thomas andersons story about a porn star is told with style grace humor even poignancy the actors and the characters they play are all firstrate including mark wahlberg in the lead who proves himself a solid actor and can carry a film burt reynolds gives perhaps his best performance ever as a porno director who discovers wahlberg the film recreates the late s and early s with deadon accuracy from the disco scene that begins the film to wahlbergs don johnson miami vice outfit that he wears in the final scene most regular moviegoers who see this film will no doubt compare it to pulp fiction but it really has much more in common with the films of robert altman and martin scorsese the film is a triumph in style the opening tracking shot that begins the film is just as impressive as the ones in the player and absolute beginners the editing by dylan tichenor is simply phenomenal i couldnt believe the editing didnt receive an oscar nomination good will hunting was a better edited film the best scene in the film has to be the one with the firecrackers i had butterflies in my stomach because the scene is incredibly intense when i saw the film a second time i had the exact same reaction to the scene unfortunately it may not have the same impact on tv as it did in a theater with good stereo sound its a shame that many people didnt see this movie during its theatrical run because it is the best way to watch it andersons use of widescreen will suffer on tv so get the dvd or a letterbox tape it is amazing how easy anderson makes it all look because this is only his second film the music sets costumes photography offbeat characters sex violence happiness and heartbreak are captured by a guy who is clearly in love with filmmaking
