NEG this movie was terrible john wayne is a brutal actor at times the lead female playing the role of maura did a good job and tried her best to make scenes believable despite waynes inept one dimensional over acting seriously did you see him when he was supposed to be talking in his sleep ridiculous and his character became such an awful person in the second half of the movie and then did nothing to atone for his behavior and is still forgiven by everyone including his arch nemesis without even so much as a sorry the story was completely implausible we were supposed to believe that two grown men both tremendous successes in their respected fields would sabotage a job and risk the lives of innocent men simply because they disliked one another you can pretty much randomly select any scene and it will probably leave you shaking your head in disbelief that someone paid money to have this film made its too bad because the only other wayne films ive seen are the shootist and rio bravo which were both great movies unless youre being paid dont bother watching this one
