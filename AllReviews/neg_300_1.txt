NEG jefferey dahmer was one sick guy theres not much to say about him that hasnt already been said except that the many documentaries and films made about him are probably better than this one its ridiculously cheesy its so cheesy a guy who posted the whole film on youtube added some annotations to make the viewer laughbr br carl crew whos he stars as serial killer jeffrey dahmer whos killing spree began in  with a young guy dahmer just wanted to be friends with a finally in  with a man he wished to have sex with and eatbr br i didnt bother to watch the whole film through its basically a documentary that shows all the attacks dahmer pulled off before he got caught and since this film was made in  one year before dahmer was bludgeoned to death by a fellow inmate the death of dahmer isnt shown but it probably wouldve been as cheesy as this cheesefestbr br
