NEG a new generation is the third amityville entry to base its plot around writer john g joness premise of an item taken from the long island house that causes spectral misery and death for its new owners first a lamp then a clock and now a mirror however this is also the first amityville since the possession to directly tie in to the real life events that started the whole series this time around keyes terry robert partridge an artist is given a macabrelooking mirror by a homeless man one day soon enough people around him start to die eventually leading to his discovery that the mirror once hung in the amityville house  indeed on the very night a man named franklin bronner sonny montelli in amityville ii murdered his entire family unfortunately for terry his discovery of the mirror isnt entirely coincidental and he soon learns the truth about his past a truth hes kept buried since childhoodbr br this th installment in the often wornout franchise is something of a disappointment for me things were starting to pick up with the silly and uneven yet entertaining its about time and given how much this film tries to draw upon its roots  not the first episode but the source material itself  it should have been better than it was br br however three trips to the same well with yet another evil artifact from the amityville house with yet another explanation for the malign paranormal visitations is wearing on me to say the least one of the biggest weaknesses of the amityville franchise is the steadfast determination by each set of producers to completely ignore every other episode in the series on the one hand its perfectly reasonable that they dont want to be tied to someone elses continuity but at the very least they could maybe acknowledge story lines that have already been done and just possibly not repeat them over and over againbr br theres also something rather plodding about the way in which the story unfolds doubtless due to the inevitability this repetitionfest brings since you already know whats going to happen the carefullypaced buildup is simply slow and tedious or maybe its just tedious anyway director john murlowski probably could have done more to heighten the tense atmosphere associated with the mirror rather than simply having it flash red and emit chattering evil voices which lacks any kind of subtlety there were times when characters seemed fairly unfazed by its otherworldly qualities if they dont take it too seriously why should webr br which is a shame because a new generation has a morethancapable cast i was going to hold off on watching this until i saw the name julia nickson in the credits she captivated my attention just as she always does and if anything i was annoyed her part wasnt more extensive terry oquinn was equally charismatic and again underused partridge himself in the lead role clearly fits the early s overcoiffed lumberjackshirted squarejawed hero type and while im not sure he really gave it the gravitas needed its not as if anyone here is performing ibsenbr br the sets are also worthy of note from the dramatic artwork filling sukis room to the claustrophobic corridors featured in flashbacksupernatural sequences getting the look of these right is especially important given how certain sequences are repeated throughout the film to simulated fragmented memories clearly murlowski is more of a visual director rather than either an actors director or one of horror unfortunately it is meant to be a horror film after allbr br a new generation sees the same race being run for the third time in  years add to this the lack of direction where it was really needed and the whole effort fails to stand as tall as it should however it should be acknowledged for its strong ties with the source material and some good actors in not necessarily their finest hours honestly the ideal person for this is someone who hasnt seen any of the sequels past the possession for whom the story wont be such a massive dejavu trip
