POS i saw this fine flick shortly leaving college as i sat there happily watching alice go from repressed virgin to sexual adventurer i got to wondering why her sexual encounters seemed familiar then i remembered intro psych  lecture one of the lectures dealt with the psychosexual stages of developement basically the shift over time on what part of the body and its attendant stimulations gets our main attention as well as the changing emphasis on what gives us pleasure alices first encounter is being bathed with emphasis on the genitals and bottom her next encounter is an oral one with the mad hatters dingaling i forget the rest of the lecture and the order of alices encounters but i do remember how well they matched its interesting to see a skin flick with some brains behind it rather than the cliche im here to deliver your pizza lets screwbr br i dont see how kristin debells career could be wrecked by this film as it was her first film and reagans tiresome hypocrisies had yet to mar this land when it was released but in a way he and his stooge meese did affect ms debell when meese was staging his antipornography commission to distract people from his own criminal activities meese hired the services of an antiporn activist named judith reisner reisner was obsessed with images she perceived as child pornography she saw the alice cover ms debell did for playboy and promptly announced she had scientifically proven that ms debell was in fact a photo collage of parts from several grown women and the face of a ten year old yeah right
