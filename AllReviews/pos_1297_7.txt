POS this movie was made only  years after the end of the civil warmost likely in anticipation of the th anniversary of the end of the war in the film there are recreations of battles and the people of the era that look rather impressive and realistic it also provides a different and more balanced view than just its contemporary birth of a nationa patently absurd and racist film because of this this short film would be excellent for use in the classroom to discuss the war and tell the story of a very young man that runs away to enlist as a drummer the boy makes good and is a hero though the film ends rather melodramaticallya definite convention of the day not a great film but a decent plot decent acting and little of the overthetop acting you often saw in other films of the daybr br one annoying aspect of this film was the too frequent use of title cards to describe or set the stage for stuff that was really obvious it got annoying from time to time
