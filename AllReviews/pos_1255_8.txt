POS when the first trailer for this film was viewed by myself i was curious as to what angle the storyline would take after all the plot of having ones childhood self return to the present leaves open many options bruce willis however does a superb job in the role he was given i was surprised to see just how well he could act in this part this is also a good career move as many others have said but after seeing it i now agree this film is mainly about remembering the kid you used to be and coming to the realization that you arent the adult you planned to be this is a wonderful story and a gripping tale that makes us all think usually we scorn at what if movies for example waterworld attempted to answer the question what if the world were to be covered with water and but truthfully nobody cared this movie however effects everyone in the theatre true young children may not fully grasp the idea of growing up and having all your dreams fizzle away but it leaves a great impact on the adults and parents of those children this movie is definitely worth seeing although it will be better the second time around because you wont be thinking so much about how the kid got there and why and all that stuff just relax and have fun and take something with you when you leave that cinema take that piece of your childhood youve forgotten and enjoy it
