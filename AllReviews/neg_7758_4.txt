NEG s kid show with exvaudevillians playing handy men for hire as you can expect they are a disaster at everything they do over the course of the  minute episodes leaving  minutes for commercials in the  minute time slot they do things like set up a fence between warring neighbors help a magician on stage and deal with a found trunk and walletbr br growing up i had never run across this show which appears to have been shot in new york i thought i had run heard of or seen a most of the childrens shows from the period either through having watched them as a kid or viewed them at nostalgia conventions until alpha video released it on dvd i had been completely unaware if its existencebr br the show plays like the three stooges mixed with abbott and costello as done by people aping the routines indeed one of the pair claims to have created the legendary slowly i turned routine that abbott and costello perfected its not bad but its really not good either since everything seems watered down the timing is often off though that maybe due to bad direction and the jokes were recycled years before the show first ran odds are youve seen it all before  on the plus side its the type of thing that would be perfect to introduce very young kids to the magic of vaudeville style comedy however its going to be trying for parents to sit through even with the short episodesbr br for nostalgia junkies only everyone else should look to seeing an abbott and costello or three stooges original
