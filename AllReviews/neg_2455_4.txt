NEG from  peter lorre made a string of highly successful mr moto films while technically bfilms they were much better made than typical films of the genre however lorre tired of making these highly repetitive films and told friends he wanted out of the series when it was canceled in  lorre was thrilled but his plans of getting more complicated and satisfying roles did not materialize when he moved to columbia pictures island of doomed men is one of these films and its pretty obvious the studio isnt putting much effort into the movie as i think the plot was written by penguins talented penguins perhapsbut still the movie made little sense at allbr br it begins with a guy agreeing to be an undercover agent for the government he is to infiltrate an island in the us where something strange is amiss now they easily could have just got a search warrant to do this but given that penguins were writing the film the agent takes the rap for a murder he didnt commit and spends a year in prison for this he apparently hopes that hell be paroled to this island as many parolees are sent there when they finish the termbr br there are some more serious problems with this idea first they only have him serve a year before getting paroledbut he was convicted of murder and he refused to divulge who he really was they would never parole anyone in a case like this second what if he wasnt paroled to the island he would have spent an entire year in jail for nothing third why not just have scuba divers or paratroopers or cops in boats come to the island talk about a contrived plot br br once on the island the agent discovers that evil peter lorre has set up his own private prison and staffed it with guys on parole as slave labor what about the men having to report to their parole officers this was never explained but lorre was using them to mine for diamonds and they were treated abominably now another question i had was that if lorre was discovering huge diamonds there he was a very wealthy man so why not just pay people to mine for the diamonds why set up your own version of devils island and savagely beat and kill the men br br eventually lorre gets whats his and the islands slaves are released unfortunately by then i really didnt care overall watchable but rather dumb lorres career only took a turn for the better when he moved the following year to warner brothers with films like island of doomed men i could see why his stay at columbia was short
