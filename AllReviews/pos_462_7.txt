POS good show really good acting and the director takes us swimming through his storyline in an interesting unpredictable way especially since essentially its two people in a room it doesnt race through like many modern films but doesnt drag either bohl is flippant enough to believe her in the now of her character which is still involved and not going back on her career choices  so it is believable without the need for her to show us a deep selfexamination of her soulbrundage has the delicate balance of weight innocence meekness and class to pull off buddy very well a bit grainy on the film quality but it fits the tone of the story could use a little polishing on the hair and makeup end of things but definitely worth watching
