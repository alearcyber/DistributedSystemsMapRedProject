POS i viewed this movie at the magnolia theater in dallas a couple of days ago punk everyone and everything involved in the movie added to the punkiness of it the music well of course but the movie itself captured the whole punk genre even a grandmother and school teacher me can appreciate artists who are able to turn their ideas into reality well reality filmwise this movie takes a handful of tickedoff young film makers and clearly and cleverly shows the why of their angst over not being given the green light on finishing the waldo film the relatively happy girl gave good comic relief a nice respite from the continual but understandable ragging on the dude who left them in a lurch gotta love stu though and be sure to watchread the credits  theyre the icing on the cake
