NEG after watching the steven spielberg version of war of the worlds in theaters i was hooked on the topic i could think back to my favorite parts in the movie people getting vaporized people panicking fire explosions it was all so greatbr br so a few weeks later i enter my video store and i see david michael latts version of war of the worlds on the shelf it couldnt have come onto dvd that fast could it i said to myself i read the back of the case and saw c thomas howell instead oh i remember him from the outsiders so i thought it might have been a trybr br i was wrong dead wrong as soon as i watched the opening credits watched them take forever i knew something was wrong something was going to disappoint me in this film and it did the whole movie stunk like a cheese sauce that was left in the fridge for  years from the acting the special effects stupid looking tripod things when people get vaporized they turn into orange skeletons and most of all it didnt even come close to being as interesting as the spielberg version in fact the plot was boring and there were only  scenes of destruction what the crap i ended up being so bored that i had to fast forward through the movie until i found something that looked even remotely interesting and nothing was reallybr br my advice dont even touch this movie stay  feet away from it the spielberg version is coming out near the end of this month buy that one but please please i beg of you stay away from this turd before it smothers us all
