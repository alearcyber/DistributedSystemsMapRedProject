NEG i have rarely laughed so hard at a movie notice that i laughed at iron eagle not with it because this is probably the stupidest film i have ever seen with the obvious exception of scifi monstrosity cybertracker you should also remember that this film is not a comedybr br even overlooking the preposterous plot the idea that a yearold could walk into a us air force base steal an f fly to the middle east and kill about a thousand people without anyone noticing is beyond belief the film is full of ridiculous action scenes that make little or no sense for example at various points doug masters uses a machinegun on his plane to shoot a steel girder a control tower and a tent all of these things explode in a massive fireball why the enemy aircraft also explode in a strange way reminiscent of a paper aeroplane being blown up with a fireworkbr br on the plus side i did actually enjoy this film admittedly not in the way the makers probably wanted it to be enjoyed but all the same i laughed at it and later bought the dvd its also improved by the awesome presence of david suchet as the evil terrorist leader maybe youll recall him as mustachioed belgian detective poirot overall then the film is a laugh and a lighthearted alternative to more serious fighterplane movies like top gun even if it is just as subtly homoerotic check out the manhug between doug and chappy somethings going on between em
