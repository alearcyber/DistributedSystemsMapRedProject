NEG wow i just witnessed one of the greatest poker tragedies and im not talking about the premature death of the great stu ungar this film im sorry to say was terrible absolutely terrible a true tragedy in filmaking history well maybe im being a little harsh but unless you have some interest in the life of stu ungar then dont even consider coming near this one and those that do have an interest in his life will find that most parts were trivialised and made out to be great novelty scenes i watched it because of stu ungar but nearly wanted to end myself like he did while watching this movie  stars for effort but unpleasantly painful
