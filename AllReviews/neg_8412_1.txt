NEG i usually seek to find good in movies even the bad onesunfortunately this movie is one where i fail miserablyand the fact that theres barely one positive review on this board shows many imdb reviewers share my painbr br i dont usually watch sequels but i just had to see this since i love rosemarys baby so much what a mistake that was it simply reaffirms my belief in the fact that most sequels are lousythough thankfully very few are as bad as this in fact in my mind this isnt even really a sequel its a satire on how bad a sequel can be movie recommended very highly for not viewingat any timeever
