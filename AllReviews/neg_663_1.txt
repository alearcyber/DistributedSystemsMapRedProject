NEG i got stuck in traffic i live in sicily on the way to the theater at a military base to see superman returns was  minutes late and the only other movie playing was see no evil there was no poster up for it and just a short description of the movie on the schedulebut my girlfriend and i decided to check it outas soon as i saw it was produced by wwe i just knew it was gonna be awful the few people in the theater were laughing most of the time and it was the first movie that i honestly considered walking out on and ive seen the ringerokay i would have walked out of that one but i was too busy sleeping the death of the bad guy at the end was pretty good but other than that it was just stupid
