POS ive never read a good review for vanity fair and i cant understand why for something that was rushed through in ten days it all comes off surprisingly well though admittedly becky sharp is a better movie and miriam hopkins a better becky theres nothing to stop this one from getting a solid  at times myrna loy might seem just too cute and nice to be playing an utter bitch but at other times she just has to squint her eyes and the air temperature drops a dozen degrees meow the move to a more modern setting did not work against vanity fair and the only thing that really causes some conflict is the casting barbara kent amelia was under  feet in height and few of the leading men were very tall either  this all coming together to make loy look like an absolute amazon womanbr br vanity fair is similar to craigs wife in that no matter how bad the main character is you have to love her and you know she deserves her comeuppance and then some but you still feel sorry for her when she gets it though based on the same story as becky sharp this version had a different ending which is interesting to see because most of the rest of the films were almost identical for pleasure value the ending of becky sharp is ultimately more enjoyable although aesthetically and from the flow of the story there is no doubt that the ending of vanity fair is the better one whether or not you actually like it
