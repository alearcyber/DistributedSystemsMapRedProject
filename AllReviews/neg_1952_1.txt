NEG jack frost returns with an army of styrofoam balls that can only be foiled by being shot with supersoakers loaded with margaritas hows that for a plot the film hinges on such a ridiculous premise that it barely raises an eyebrow when characters are killed with bbq tongs and are impaled by carrots you might even say the whole movie is skating on thin ice baboomtishbr br admittedly there are some fantastic oneliners including a remark about the murderous coconut sharkbr br fair enough times are hard but that does not excuse the willingness of the actors to take part in such utter tripebr br for those fans hoping to see jack frost be prepared to accept him as merely a phallic carrot creeping up the beach with corny voiceover commentary
