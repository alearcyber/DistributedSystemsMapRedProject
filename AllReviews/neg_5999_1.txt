NEG i just cant see what everyone sees in this movie the acting is just awful the choice of music is mildly putting it peculiar there arent enough fighting scenes the plot is nonexistent and whatever small entertainment one could get from this film is ruined by the annoying way some of the movie is filmed and gives you a splitting headace
