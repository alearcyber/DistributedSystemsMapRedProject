NEG i had a different experience with this movie  it never got charming or delightful or funny for me one big clue that this was not your typical movie was that the label gave no indication of the ianguages spoken in the film another was the lack of choices re subtitlesbr br i found the lack of dialogue annoying especially when accompanied by exaggerated facial expressions as it almost always was the wildly inconsistent development of the feeble plot was puzzling were there characters or only vague gestures was there even a plotbr br on a separate matter im getting prompted to correct the spelling of dialogue with the suggested substitute of dialogue maybe this movie in its entirety including the imdb portion is designed to puzzle or amaze but im getting more irked than amused
