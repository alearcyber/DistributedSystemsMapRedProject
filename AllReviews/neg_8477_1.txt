NEG son of the mask is a terrible movie i dont like the baby and i dont like the dog jamie kennedy and his wife are a cute couple but that cant redeem sitting through this garbage even at only  minutes or so it says the movie could not end soon enough for me the only real laughs come at the beginning with a brief appearance by ben stain thats it the rest is just a rehash of the first movie actually that is just an insult to rehashes why was this sequel made this movie cost millions of dollars to make why would i sit through a movie with a baby and a dog intentionally trying to drive the dad crazy jamie kennedy is talented but he has nothing to do in this movie i am not bothering to be nice to this movie
