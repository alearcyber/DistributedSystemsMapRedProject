POS im afraid i must disagree with mr radcliffe as although he is correct in saying this isnt a comedy it has many other merits the plot is a little mad at parts but i believe it it all fits together nicely creating a satisfying enjoyable film the last scene was rather abysmal compared to the rest of the film but the actual ending of the plot a few scenes previously is very interesting showing just what someone will do under stressful circumstancesbr br i would recommend this film to fans of thrillers and action movies but if youre a fan of gangster movies then as long as you dont expect expect something as deep as goodfellas then you should still find it enjoyable
