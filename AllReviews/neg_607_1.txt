NEG i cant help but be completely annoyed by this sitcom its like they didnt even bothered trying ro write good comedy just rehash third rate jokes and hope it sticks the worst of all this is that its all so damm uninteresting and lacking in every waybr br to make things worse leading man kevin james has a permanent im so funny smug grin on his face that would be tolerable if only he once delivered in the comedy department which he doesnt he just lies there doing nothing like a big unfunny baby which takes me to the relationship between the heffernans easily the most insincere and poor representation of a married couple on any tv show really headache inducingly obnoxious remini spends the whole show as if it where a violent chore to even be around her own husband jerry stiller yanking the few laughs on the show is doing a  repetition of his role as frank costanza in seinfeld only this time his hints mostly tread on water due to the inability of the central duo in recognizing a joke even if it flew by them the episodes just drift along in a stream of nothingness their jobs add nothing and their interaction is even worsebr br this is not even a waste of talent there is no talent here this is a laughless creative desert
