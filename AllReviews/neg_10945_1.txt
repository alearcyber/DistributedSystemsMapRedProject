NEG now i like the bollywood films and im very glad they have recently gained success in the uk however suneel darshans latest effort is a deeply flawed film from start to finishbr br the idea of a modernbollywood take on amadeus was quite an exciting one that is until the two supposed musicians appear on the scene looking as if they have never touched a piece of manuscript in their lives upen patel is a very good looking man and the film plays to his narcissistic sensibilities but he is never once believable as a modern mozart in terms of acting all he can do is stand there and pout his expressions hair and clothes all look the same throughout including the scene where he is supposedly dying when in fact he appears to have nothing but a slight sniffle bobby deol playing the salieri role does his best to liven up what little wooden script there is but alas just comes across as a little bit angry when he is supposed to be fuming with jealousybr br bollywood films are widely renowned for their stunning setpieces and colour schemes but shaklaka looks like a drab bbc drama reproduction in fact the closest thing shakalaka comes to is hollyoaks as it blatantly hides a really bad script behind beautiful people looking well beautiful he has yet to reach mediocrity  the same could be said for the totally forgetful songsbr br in short darshans latest offering has no boom bang wallop or twang instead it merely plods along with its head held low hoping to catch your attention with a soft tap on the shoulder and that is not good enough at all
