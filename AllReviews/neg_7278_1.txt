NEG tagline the lucky ones diedbefore watching thisbr br ive never watched a bulgarian movie from s so i cant say this is the worst movie ever made but it surely is the worst movie ive ever watched i cant almost remember itbr br all i can recall is a family of stupid people who dont do anything right their car has one wheel out of four stuck in the sand so they decide that theres nothing to do and prepare to live the rest of their lives there then theres an old man who is aware of the existence of a band of cannibals in the whereabouts but has never considered the idea to report the fact to the policebr br and speaking of the policeif those freaks have lived around there eating humans for years lots of people must have disappearedhow come the sheriff didnt suspect anythingbr br but i gave up asking questions after the first five minutes or so the rest is bore an hallucinated unbelievable borebr br i will be merciful and wont speak about the dialogues and the acting and the effectsbr br i will only mention the final scene where the freak girl eliminates a snake the snakes they come out in the end what the hell do they have to do with the story with a sniperprecise throw of a stone demonstrating the full disregard of mr craven for reality and for things that happen on planet earth in generalbr br i believe there have been riots when the film was first released in br br even being eaten by a cannibal wouldnt be a fair punishment to the director for this attack on intelligence
