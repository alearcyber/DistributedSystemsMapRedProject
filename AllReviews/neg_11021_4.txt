NEG  breaker morant and romper stomper  it has also given us watchable films such as bootmen and the odd angry shot  unfortunately for everyone involved in this debacle the wog boy wont be joining appearing in either list br br i was looking forward to seeing this movie simply because of the politically incorrect title  so politically incorrect that when it was broadcast on bbc  late at night the announcer didnt even mention the movies name so i was expecting something so offensively anachronistic that my jaw was going to drop in disbelief  it did drop in disbelief  i found myself not being able to believe that the financiers thought this was going to be a major international hit br br the problem lies with the cast and the script  i do know that australia with its small population doesnt have a large pool of actors so ill be forgiving for the most part  but this doesnt stop my criticism of nick giannopoulos as steve  for this type of comedy to work you must be impressed with the comic skills of the lead actor and im sorry to say but nick g just doesnt have the skills  id never heard of him and seen nothing else hes been in so perhaps hes much better at other performances  here however hes just plain irritating  unconvincing and i lost count at the number of times he mugged for the camera  the jokes themselves are very flat and predictable and getting back to the script it seems very under developed  i mean who thought a running gag about a female minster of work whos having it off in the back of a limousine was funny to begin with  you do get the feeling that someone in the production should have been more honest and said  look mate  this screenplays not nearly good enough  go and make it more subtle and structured br br ive been harsh and harshness has been called for in this review  i gave the movie four out of ten and it would have only got three if it wasnt for the one genuinely funny sequence where steve is watching a current affairs show only for himself flashing up on screen and labelled a  dole blodger   this shows that the screenwriters were aware of comic timing and social comment  such a pity that they didnt come with a much better written movie
