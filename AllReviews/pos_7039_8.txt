POS i loved this show i used to actually leave the pub ten minutes before closing and run down the road to catch it i remember daniel peacocks sketch about gandhi in the newsagents as a masterpiece the set design and lighting were out of this world creating an atmosphere that you felt you were actually living in v unusual for a comedybr br unfortunately i have only encountered one other person apart from the other reviewer here who ever knew that this programme existed in fact i have to thank the imdb for coming into existence and proving to me that i hadnt in fact imagined the whole series in a drunken haze which i was seriously starting to believe
