NEG the script seems to have been wholesale ahem ahem cough cough borrowed from a certain other movie involving using a selfpropelled manned drilling machine scene by scene the two movies were almost identical just enough of the serial numbers filed off in this one to prevent a copyright infringement lawsuitbr br but other than that i have to say i found this somewhat entertaining as i enjoy deepundergroundintheearth genre of movies its a little bit on the stupid side as far as the science goes but if one is willing to squint ones eyes real hard and pretend one didnt notice that scientific gaffe here and there and all over this movie is almost bearable far better than supernova which was another flick that luke perry had a leading role in that was so dumb dumb dumb that nothing could save it a note to movie makers employ someone who knows something about the subject the movie deals with it would be a very small part of the movie budget but it would have a big effect overall in helping prevent your audience from guffawing at you for doing dumb sciencebr br production values almost passable ive seen far worse in my timebr br a new thought for disaster movies instead of them always having a happy ending where the world gets saved yet once again how about some where things are a tad bit more realistic where sometimes even the very best efforts still end up in failure particularly when the problem that needs to be resolved was caused in the first place by sheer stupidity stupiditycaused disaster movies with glowing heartwarming endings sort of backhandedly justify stupidity by stating no matter how awful a problem is caused by braindead stupidity it can be fixed which is definitely not the case a selfcaused disaster movie with an unhappy ending would serve better as cautionary tale of dont be so damn stupid in the first place should you watch this movie if youre bored and youve seen everything else in the scifi section at your local video rental store sure why not but do avoid supernova as i can assure you that youre not that bored that definitely was not one of luke perrys better movies this one is better thats not saying much but it is betterbr br one dead hoof up for being a deepunderground genre movie one dead hoof down for naughtily ripping off from the screenplay of another certain movie of the same genre
