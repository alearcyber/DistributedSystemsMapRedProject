NEG geesh i never ever ever thought id write the above four words but actually shes the highpoint of this little flickbr br as the movie was packaged when i rented it it supposedly is a comedy about a girl who is kidnapped but doesnt have her medication which keeps her stable it sounded like a cute concept for years all we ever saw of spelling was as donna martin in  and an endless parade of dull lifeless tv movies it sounded like a chance for her to stretch a little and considering that with her tv success and her rich daddy she couldnt have any financial reason to do this movie i figured she took the part because this must be a lowbudget jewelbr br wrongbr br instead spellings part is small and the bit about the mentally unbalanced kidnap victim is just one of several storylines when shes not on the screen the movie crawls so badly i couldve sworn it was longer than the  minutes that were listed on the tape this wouldve worked so much better if spellings storyline had dominated and it had been changed into a romantic comedy with her and phil the least irritating kidnapper
