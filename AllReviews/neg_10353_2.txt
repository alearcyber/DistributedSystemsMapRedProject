NEG i watched the first episode and i found it to be a very wooden performancebr br i have watched the original from its early days on big girls blouse to the last series on channel seven kath and kim was a great mocumentary and its humor is something that most people getbr br however in this american version i found it to be dull molly shannon is to fashionable to be kath day kaths wardrobe is supposed to be stuck in the s with her frizzy perm while selma blairs figure hugging clothes isnt as good as what the original kimmy wore i also found that selma seemed to be puffing her belly out a lot she is obviously a australian size  where kim should be australian a size br br the exchanges from molly and selma is obviously so scripted and there is pauses where there shouldnt be pauses or the pauses are a bit long as someone suggested there could be a laughter track in there during those pauses its like molly and shannon are not used to each other there is no motherdaughter chemistrybr br phil was okay he had the eccentric air around him like kel however craig was to handsome and not the sweet plain humble brett from the aussie versionbr br i found watching this was like watching a very bad stage play the acting was pretty much wooden and the exaggeration of selmas expressions wore the funny off after ten minutes especially her sulking scenesbr br to sum up i find this show to be a waste of time the script obviously has been dumbed down for americans which most on the board say they prefer the original if nbc wanted to show kath and kim why not pay the producers the money to screen the originalbr br all i can add is magda you are one smart cookie for not letting the producers use your character of sharon
