NEG i rented this movie because i am a huge dudikoff fan i figured it couldnt be that bad boy was i wrong at the  minute mark  i was begiing the others to let me rip the dvd out and fling it back to the rental store but they refused they swore it had to get betterbr br they were wrong this movie was lacking everything the actors delivered their lines with as much emotion as a comatose rock the plot was ridiculous and i was offended that hollywood assumed people were dumb enough to enjoy it none of the characters interacted very well with each other icet gives one of his worst performances herebr br after watching footage of the wrong plane bad guys standing up to get shot and clips being emptied and missing everything i wanted to scream and bang my head on concrete the movie hit its plateau of ignorance when the people on the space station used an elevator to travel space suits are not needed and there is gravity in space regardless of what real astronauts may saybr br i didnt finish this movie and hated it i dont want to finish this movie this is slow suicide i could feel my cerebral cortex planning to avenge the torture i put it through
