POS well i tend to watch films for one of three reasons unfortunately there are no transformers in this film so i can recommend it only on comedy value and pretty women read girlsbr br yes it is funny i know this due to the number of people in the cinema who were laughing on a regular basis throughout personally though i loved it for laura fraser who imho is fit
