NEG st watched    out of  dirmark dindal fastpaced frantic animation effort by ted turners feature animation group plays a lot like tv cartoons and leaves a lot to be desired in the area of likeable characters but definetly has extremely unlikeable villains im not even sure why the kids would like this movie because there are so many references to old movie stars that kids know very little or nothing about mediocre effort at best despite raves on the box comparing it to disney efforts like aladdin and lion king dont let this fool you  there is no comparison in story or quality
