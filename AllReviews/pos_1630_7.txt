POS i was at the premier of the movie last night in rome i am not an expert in the book however there are a great deal of changes from the book to the movie the pacing of this movie is much faster than the davinci code many things were trimmed otherwise this would be a  hour movie many things were also changed to give the movie a fast pace i think what matters is the feel of the movie and that works well for hanks brown and companybr br there are some things in the book that would appear very implausible in the movie form i am not giving any spoilers except to say the ending of the movie is handled in a slightly different way how leonardo vetra was found is also different those who see the movie might be interested in reading the book to get the full details of the story some minor details are are also cut from the moviebr br although they did film in rome they had to recreate interior shots since i went on a walking tour of rome the day before the movie i can say that the interior sites are authentic in look and feel kohler is not in the movie and not much is shown about cern hanks does a good job and there are some interesting scenes involving the vatican archives of course they had no access to that area and i am not sure if anyone actually knows what the vatican archives look like eyelet zurer has her break in this movie as victoria vetra and does a good job as eye candy for hanksbr br this movie should be received better by the critics and public but you never know ron howard mentioned several times in interviews and as we saw him and the cast before the movie that this is just a movie
