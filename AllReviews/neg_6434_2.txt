NEG now the television schedules in england at least are crammed with home improvement bargainhunting househunting and cookery shows in the afternoons the chances of any of the terrestrial broadcasters digging out a complete obscurity like this to occupy a couple of hours of screen time on a slow afternoon are slender to say the least but back in the eighties the bbc did just that and guess what i watched it and its a testament to the overwhelming weirdness of this hungarianamerican coproduction that i can still remember large chunks of it over twenty years later to begin with the eponymous hero appears briefly during the opening titles only to vanish again for at least half an hour imagine an american tail reedited so feivel is nowhere to be seen and youll appreciate how confusing this is theres a supremely bizarre bit of animation where one of the characters gets his elaborately waxed moustache tweaked and stretched complete with a boingy sound effect that causes him to go bosseyed probably hilarious if youre stoned but to a child quite disturbing speaking of which the infamous hippo cull scene is represented in an abstract manner  clouds in vague hippo shapes are struck by lightning  but its still pretty unpleasant in fact this film is pretty cold and uninvolving throughout a sad state of affairs hardly helped by the strangelooking production design all muddy colours wobbly lines bloated forms and that uniquely european bleakness reminiscent of jan svankmajer only not as compelling then to cap it all we get songs by the osmonds this isnt so much an awful film as a deeply misguided one not so much phantasmagorical as a rather bad trip
