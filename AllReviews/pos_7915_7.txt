POS eisensteins first sound film retells the battle of the ice of  when the russians under alexander nevsky defeated the livonian knights eager to bring russia under roman catholicism made in  nevsky can be seen as a piece of propaganda the germanic knights with their sinister and somewhat goofy helmets are obvious standins for the nazis the butchery by the knights when they enter a russian town seems a prophetic warning of the massacres of world war ii the film ends with a warning those who came to russia with the sword will die by the sword made in delicate black and white somewhat reminiscent of a daguerreotype it also marked eisensteins return to official favor by the late s stalin wanted soviet filmmakers to stop experimentation and made movies that would be more populist and palatable to the russian public that stopped eisensteins career in russia for a decade and in nevsky he came back with his more accessible film nevskys strong point is in its second half which features the battle itself and it is justly seen as a milestone in movie history never before and probably never after a battle would be so vivid in the screen another strong point is prokofievs beautiful haunting soundtrack using a composer to score a movie was completely unusual at the time one of its weaker points the comic relief in the form of two simpleton russian warriors trying to woo a beautiful russian peasant is really jarring
