POS this movie is based mainly on the emotions and interactions of people there are only three locations the school the store and the coachs house that are really used its primarily at the coachs house however a movie doesnt need special effects or amazing views to be amazing in itselfbr br four friends who had bonded during their basketball days meet up one is rich important and has no real love outside of money one wants to be mayor again but his competition is turning him sour one wants to be superintendent of the school and take care of his family one is a traveling alcoholicbr br first off i love the actors in this film theyve all been household names to me they proved their worth herebr br one of the most pivotal moments is when tom played by gary sinise blows up on the coach he yells and rants about how the coach cheated in the winning game his blows the coachs whistle and yells back his catchphrases  forgive me father for i have sinned its amazing to watch with energy that just chills youbr br highly recommended to anyone who understands human emotion and doesnt need shiny effects to interest them
