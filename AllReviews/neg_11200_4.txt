NEG i went out of my way to get this film and was fortunate to get it on vhs being a big gloria grahame fan it was an excellent addition to my collection other than that i really cannot say a lot to recommend this picture the plot is predictable and weak and the only interesting aspect of the film is watching sterling hayden get into deeper trouble with his own department ms grahame is always fun to watch if you like her as i do but the dubbing of her singing hurts this picture a lot she works in a dive so let her use her own voice it can only lend to the atmosphere i must agree with an earlier reviewer the ending borrows heavily from the big heat to the point of detracting from the ending i have seen worse films with ms grahame macao but i will never pass the opportunity to see her on screen if you are having a movie night and looking for a second feature film this is your movie enjoy the picture
