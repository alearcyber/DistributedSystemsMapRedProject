POS it must be said that the director of the cell tarsem singh has quite handily established himself with his first feature which happens to rank as one of the most visually astounding films in contemporary cinemabr br the cell is more of a visceral experience than a film as a thriller it rises above most of its peers with competent editing and a chilling score effectively providing an exceptionally suspenseful atmosphere however it is ultimately tarsems skill for elaborate and disturbing set design and imagery that carries the films jolting sense of terrorbr br as with several recent films i have been shocked by the alarming hypocrisy among those who have commented negatively about the cell in defence of the film i will address a few of these issues the plot appears to be the main concern and while it is not revolutionary and borrows heavily from the silence of the lambs it was never intended to be the most important aspect of the film the plot itself is a vehicle through which tarsems visionsimultaneously horrifying and wondrousis presented to the audience much in the same way that the plot of the silence of the lambs is secondary to the fascinating study of its two lead characters lecter and starling while the silence of the lambs is clearly the superior film it is irrational for one to condemn the plot of the cell and in the same breath praise that of the silence of the lambsbr br my final concern is the mention of mtv style directing it pains me to see the condemnation of directors who use innovative camera and cinematography techniques a camera has the potential to be much more than simply a tool with which to record events angles pans colour adjustment and so forth are all used to their full extent in the cell with the purpose of creating the sense of a dreamlike state that could not have been otherwise achieved this is essential to the film as the entire premise behind it is the visualization of a serial killers subconscious if you simply want a series of static shots stick to stage plays and give up cinema altogetherbr br that being said the cell is thoroughly entertaining terrifying and breathtaking in both its pacing and design anyone who is able to look past theperhaps uninspired yet never dullscreenplay will find one of the best films of the year
