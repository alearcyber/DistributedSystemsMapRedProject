POS this is a pretty good documentary im not a skateboarder i dont particularly like skateboarding or skateboard culture but somehow for about  hours this movie made me interested in the subjectbr br i wouldnt call it the most intriguing film of all time but for some reason when those guys were talking about how they started their skateboard clubs and were skating in those empty southern california pools i was interestedbr br i should also add that the music in this film was pretty good too i dont sit around yearning to hear more s rock bands but it seemed appropriate for what they were talking about
