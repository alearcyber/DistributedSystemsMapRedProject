NEG not one of monograms betternot trying to be amusing here eitherchan entries the shanghai cobra has a lot going for it but in the end is just way too confusing and cluttered to be overly satisfying the film opens with a murderer named the shanghai cobra having already struck twice and now is about in a scene at a diner in some way we have a guy a girl and another guy having some implied connection when one guy dies in the streets yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film  it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation i havent even gone into the diner cook who has some involvement and a juke box that talks to you and has a screen and everyone doesnt seem to have a problem with that all this is in the first five minutes or so then chan enters film working for the government and flying out to help a friend he also has right to check a banks store of radium and is looking for a man wrapped in bandages that he helped arrest in shanghai many years earlier i found the plot very involved as stated earlier toler is back as chan he is ever affable benson fong and mantan moreland are back too both do good jobs and are quite amusing but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance this isnt a bad movie not just a very interesting one except for the most devoted of chan fans
