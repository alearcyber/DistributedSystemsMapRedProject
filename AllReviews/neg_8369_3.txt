NEG im sort of between the gushy review and the hate review ive been a fan of lovecraft and a lovecraft purist for a long time and while this little amateur film was of poor quality it had a number of redeeming qualities i went into viewing expecting the worst thing ive ever seen and wondering if lovecraft would turn in his grave over it but i was shocked to find that i actually kind of liked itbr br i dont want to catalog the movies faults so ill only mention a few that keep this movie from being a stellar amateur effortbr br its very low budget and shot on a video cam so it has the look of some soap operas but once you get used to the idea then it ceases to be a big deal the direction is pretty amateur and the shot framing and use of distance in the shots is rather clumsy still this film was actually kind of creepy and it stayed more faithful to lovecraftian intent than nearly all the stuart gordan and brian yuzna travesties my main exception to those films being reanimator and dagon put together the idea of being impregnated by some old one is reminiscent of dunwich horror and shadow over innsmouth which isnt to say this movie is as good as those stories so the overall plot is quite faithful to lovecrafts ideas one thing that annoyed me was that words out of the bible seemed to make a zombie prisoner upset and afraid im not sure if this was meant to indicate that gods words upset the old ones or just this particular zombie there was no real answer to that the rest of the christian symbolism in it reminds me of august derleths take on the mythos so in a way this was a derleth style take on the mythosbr br i would recommend this film only as a curiosity it shows how a fairly atmospheric movie can be made with nearly zero budget i liked the setting of the wine cellars the outdoor shots were sad though using the same stretch of beach and trees and nearly the same damn shot to convey  characters long journey was really sad the director needs whack upside the head for that the acting was standard for an amateur film with the blonde zombie girl getting a personal award for best impersonation of gollum by an italian actress actually i think this film was done prior to the lord of the rings movies maybe andy sedaris watched her and thought dang shed make a great gollum br br one little kudo to the director though the makeup on the zombies was like bad goth kids i was upset seeing this and nearly stopped watching i was like oh so thats how we know shes evil and possessed but later on in the movie you see a girl painting makeup like that on the face of an older woman both living so it wasnt an attempt to say goth makeup  zombie but rather goth makeup was left on after zombification however possessedzombie does equal blue contact lenseshehbr br on the whole i still liked this movie better than the yuzna and gordan films barring the aforementioned exceptions yuzna and gordan had much better budgets but this film did a better job at filming a lovecraftlike story than they did and on a tiny budgetbr br one quick word to the the makeup artist i know you wanted claws or something on zariahs fingers but long black presson nails looked really sillybr br a quick word to the writer of the score i know you couldnt resist and apparently neither could the director who okayed it but when the two characters square off with guns for a duel playing that little whistle from the good the bad and the ugly killed any mood that scene had accumulated it was cute but cute wasnt appropriatebr br the filmmakers of this movie have read lovecraft and had a great deal of respect for him i enjoyed the little nods here and there the character carter with the bad dreams and the character pickman who becomes a ghoulish zombie
