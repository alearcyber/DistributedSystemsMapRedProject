NEG what could have been some majorly creepy stuff ends up being an incomprehensible nutty motion picture that even the filmmakers themselves probably didnt understand had they shown more of the satanic ritual or whatever it might have been creepier but as it stands now this is a waste of time and brain cells is anybody else getting sick of the whole little kid drawing creepy pictures with crayon thing could there possibly be a bigger horror clich probably not i know i know its from some different country and its far too refined and sophisticated for me to understand so i shouldnt expect the plot to be spoonfed to me blah blah blah whatever i still say the movie blows
