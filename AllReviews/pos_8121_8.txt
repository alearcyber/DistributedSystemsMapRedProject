POS after a long wait bedrooms and hallways made it to perth cinemas  not a commercial one mind you  and i thought it was fun honest and took a swipe at those tribal scream groups running around trying to find meaning in rocks and whats behind my eyes it is playing to full houses over here because it tells a story has terrific acting and says something about the human condition
