NEG just how bad well compared to this movie cannibal holocaust is citizen kane theres the stilted acting the atrocious dialogue the half baked plot and like its companion piece way too much in the way of on screen animal slaughter that was actually done unlike holocaust ferox is a straight forward movie it doesnt pretend to be a pseudo documentary in some ways that helps the production in that the film is very sharp and crisp compared to holocausts graininess unfortunately we are once again given a group of people who are morally reprehensible they torture the natives and essentially bring everything that they get upon themselves theres really nothing in this film that makes it worth your while i was fairly lenient with my review of holocaust due to some actual attempt at a statement and style but in feroxs case there is no reason to watch this unless you solely get off on blood and gore
