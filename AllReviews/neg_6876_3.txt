NEG yes said title line does actually appear in this movie why im not sure when the line was actually being said didnt somebody in the crew filming at some point laugh i would have liked to see the outtakes from this movie mostly because i think they would be more entertaining than the movie itselfbr br helmed by director jim gillespie i know what you did last summer comes a teen slasher movie that seems to assume we havent ever seen a teen slasher movie before of course hes not to be given all the blame there are also three writers responsible and this is somehow based on a video game thats still in production the title of said game is backwater but upon looking for information on it i came up with absolutely nothingbr br and so we begin the movie i would like to say before i continue that i wasnt expecting this to win an oscar when i am in the right mindset i enjoy a fun horror movie to pass the time i think there exists an opportunity for an effective original and smart slasher movie venom is not this moviebr br there is almost no character development at all thats fine you dont expect a whole lot however instead of a wellknit cast of a few this movie decides to introduce us to the following many horror movie clich charactersbr br  the final girl she has just broken up for her boyfriend this means that at some point in the movie when they are in peril they will decide to get back together again which more than likely means he will die and she will be the last remaining survivor of the movie eden is played by agnes bruckner without much enthusiasm i might addbr br  the boyfriend hes just around to coexist with the final girl until his demise sure he can save her but hes doomed and we know it eric is played by jonathan jacksonbr br  the bimbos usually horror movies only feel the need for one of these but here we have two they shoplift they steal they might show their breasts not in this case or they might possibly be alcoholics a staple of the genre they also wander around in dimly lit areas all on their lonesome usually saying things like hello is there anybody there tammy and patty suitably named are played by bijou phillips and davetta sherwoodbr br  the jackass sure he looks pretty but hes the idiot in the movie thats inserted purely to be an idiot he says stupid things does stupid things has obviously never seen a horror movie and is one of enjoyable kills you watch this kind of thing for sean is played by dj cotronabr br  the girlfriend she loves the jackass even though pretty much nobody else does and shes usually the one left alive for a while so she can scream and cry until she starts tripping and gets left behind rachel is played by laura ramseybr br  the creepy janitor in this case the creepy gas station attendant enough said ray is played by rick cramerbr br i could continue but i think you get the picture the remaining characters arent so much common as they are equally killable theres the gay guy pawel szajda as ricky who definitely got robbed as far as screen time is concerned and the one who knows whats going on of course none of that matters because at first everyone always thinks that ones crazy cece is played by meagan goodbr br there are a couple other characters namely a deputy played by method man but he and others are killed off pretty quickly and get even less character development than the following clichsbr br so youre probably thinking why does this movie require such a deep analysis its just a summer horror flick for cryin out loud based on that question does it deliver the goods yes and no the acting isnt particularly convincing even given the amount of talent involved bijou phillips was hailed for her performance in larry clarks bully and agnes bruckner has been an upandcoming talent for a while nowbr br so what about the gore theres some thats really about it a lot of the juiciest bits are cutaways namely a scene involving somebodys face and a sandblaster used to remove paint from carsbr br to the filmmakers credit there are a couple interesting scenes i liked the bit where part of a house was literally ripped off so that the unstoppable villain could get to the charactersbr br if this had all been centered around a smarter screenplay in which the characters didnt make the same dumb mistakes literally hundreds of horror movie characters had made before them it might have made for a more enjoyable experience all of the most interesting characters are immediately killed off in the first third of the movie and then it just becomes a notparticularlyinteresting countdown until we know its just the creepy janitor and the final girlbr br i suppose i must be a little jaded but as a horror film fan im left wondering why i should have bothered when i could easily have written a better screenplay myself i wont even mention the numerous instances of terrible cgi
