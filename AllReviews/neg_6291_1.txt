NEG the movie is an adaptation of a japanese story by the respected author yukio mishima it simply doesnt make the transition into a credible story about brits and americansbr br the story moves sluggishly especially the part where miles and kristofferson are separated and the director fills in with the cliched shots of a ships prow cutting through the waves and the little route line filling in on the maps while their letters are heard in overvoice the film moves so languidly that i even fastforwarded through the sex and masturbation scenes which although long are not really either passionate or erotic the film did achieve a measure of notoriety when kristoffersons thenwife divorced him for extracurricular activities with miss miles during the filming i guess they enjoyed the sex scenes but it isnt quite the same for a viewerbr br there are no characters to hang on to the sexually frustrated widow is unlikeable the little kid is detestable kristofferson is amiable enough but he just doesnt have the acting skills to bring much to the role although perhaps we dont really want get too involved with him considering his ultimate fatebr br as for the little kid well he kinda falls in with a bad crowd after his dad dies and they help him plot some evil against the man who enters his mums life now this is a really bad crowd they dont just shoplift and smoke dope nosireebib they slip a mickey to a cat and vivisect it this is shown in gory detail but of course this is only practice so they can do the same thing to kristoffersonbr br so the movie mostly moves slowly with no characters to relate to and when something does happen it is unrelentingly morbidbr br the ending is about as unsatisfying as any movie youll ever seebr br this all might have made some sense if the japanese locale and cultural context had been retained as it stands it is just abysmalbr br
