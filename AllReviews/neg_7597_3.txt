NEG given that roger corman attached his name to this production i had high hopes for this film corman directed many memorable low budget horror flicks in the s i particularly enjoyed his adaptations of poes stories such as the house of usher and the pit and pendulum and the raven which starred the late great vincent price these films had solid acting atmosphere suspense strong characterization intriguing plot development and delivered some chilling moments sadly house of the damned for the most part sacrifices these qualities in lieu of cheesy low budget special effects gratuitous nudity and mindless gore topped with cliche fast edits and camera anglesbr br house of the damned starts off interestingly with some beautiful location shots in ireland but its straight downhill from here unfortunately instead of spending some time building atmosphere creating characters we might care about or building suspense  the director opts to begin running up the body count after a brief introduction to the lead characters a young couple and their daughter the audience spends the balance of the film being bounced from one spooky event to another which in this film substitutes for coherent plot development the lead characters are so ill conceived and are so badly acted  the audience doesnt care what happens to them to make matters worse the spooky events are either utterly clich or unconvincing due to low tech  low budget special effects the soundtrack has been lifted from the omen the plot what little there is borrows heavily from poltergeist and the legend of hell house but lacks any of the qualities which made these films convincingbr br if you interested in seeing well done haunted house flicks i recommend you check out classics like the haunting  the innocents  or look into cormans early american international films and pass on house of the damned unless youre masochistic or mindlessbr br   out of br br rob rheubottombr br wpg mb canada
