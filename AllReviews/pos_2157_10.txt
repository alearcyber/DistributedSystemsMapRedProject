POS hard justice is an excellent action movie the whole movie is really nothing but shooting and fighting but it does have a very good vampire plot for the people who say they dont make shoot em ups and fighting films like they use to well this one is really hardcore don the dragon wilson is excellent and his character is really cool in the movie nicholas guest was very good as well and he arguably steals the show he really performs as a fantastic villain melanie smith was also good i think that this very fine looking actress is very underrated michael cavanaugh was good it was really cool to see vince murdocco in this film as for the action it is truly awesome with all of the gun fights and the super cool fighting scenes the fighting in this picture is really some of the greatest i have seen there is so much that happens in the  minute run time for the action fans you will be blown away by all of the fire power and superb fighting that this film has to offer night hunter is a movie that isnt easy to locate and if you are at a video store and you see it for sale buy it up because this movie is big keeper and plus the box is cool there is a ton of action that has to be seen to be believed look and see if you can find some good deals on ebay halfcom amazoncoms zshops and market place sellers in my opinion night hunter is one of the greatest fighting films that i have ever watched and the characters are so neat if you like don the dragon wilson and want to see nicholas guest in a great performance then i strongly recommend that any action movie fan who loves shoot em ups fighting movies and vampire films and has been disappointed by other movies that has the look of a true non stop action flick but fails to deliver it to get and buy night hunter today
