NEG i was invited to an early screening of the movie about four months before it was released i had to watch the film and later fill out a packet on my thoughts it was the hardest thing to sit through on earth the show just crawls by and you quickly begin wishing you were dead the thing is there are two types of mormon films the good ones with actual good stories and the crappy ones that just plain stink saints and soldiers now there is a good movie but with these wannabecomedies the writers and the actors just try too hard basically they try to be funny when they are not no wonder why there is such a small target audience for these films theyre filled with inside jokes that arent funny to begin with and they just try to poke fun at average things its the story that makes the movie and the stories for these movies are just weak i bet you can guess what my packet looked like when i was told to fill it out after the movie
