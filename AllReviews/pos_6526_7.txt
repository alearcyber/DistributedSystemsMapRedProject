POS a  dvd can be a gamble and this was one that sort of paid offbr br a decent saturday night type movie that entertains if you gloss over the obvious plot flaws special effects are a bit few and far between with some repetition and why does london always look as if its in the s br br if it had the budget of say armageddon then im sure it would have performed better at the box office as the story is quite a good onebr br overall tycus is consigned to b movie history but if you see it for  then its worth buying
