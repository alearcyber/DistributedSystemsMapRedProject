POS this is a bewildering absurdist short a miller dressed in white makes his way towards us from a windmill in a desolate landscape although the image is pared down there is an obvious logic here however he is stopped by the sweep all in black because of his work they start pummelling each other for no particular reason  did the snooty miller insult the sooty sweep is this class war br br whatever he pelts his adversary with bags of grain which fly all over the fight making redundant everything he had done prior to the fight making redundant the windmill so that all becomes as pointless as the fight the millers grain whitens the sweeps blackness  later westerns wouldnt be so subtle heroes and villains being colourcoded is there a racial tint here br br if this wasnt marvellous enough the fighters are chased off the screen by a crowd of people who came from nowhere an appropriately kafkaesque ending to an odd story or are they just the social conscience rising up against a fight that negates order and purpose and very unusual in the days of early silent cinema this mix of comedy surrealism and the absurd is an obvious forerunner for buster keaton while the windmill reminds us of one of the great thrillers hitchcocks foreign correspondant
