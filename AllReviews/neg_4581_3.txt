NEG living in edinburgh and have a great thirst for history i was very put off by the libertys taken wrong breed of dog for a start bobbys owner old jock was an old single man who came to edinburgh and died a pauper in lodgings not like in the film at all for anyone coming to edinburgh and hoping to see sights of the filmyou will not find the graveyard in princes st gardens there were a few moments were a tissues would have been great the actors were fantastic at padding out a rather flimsy script i dont feel the poor wee bobby actually got enough screen time possibly due to being lost at one point all that said the film was fine and any  yr old will enjoy
