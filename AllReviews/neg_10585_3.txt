NEG when a loser teen is bitten by an insect he becomes the superhero dragonflybr br superhero movie is the latest spoof movie to hit the screens sadly however despite the presence of david zucker who was involved with airplane top secret and the naked gun movies it still suffers from the fault most recent spoofs havemainly its more dumb than fun the fault mainly lies with the gags its simply not funny enough some of the jokes do work such as the nail gun scene but other parts simply fall flat the xmen spoof for example or the whole farting sequence blazing saddles this isnt one of the key things about the best spoof movies like airplane is that although the dialog is extremely funny the cast for the most part play is completely straight this makes it even funnier even when there is simple dialog in the foreground there may well be funny things happening behind the cast again funny the other key thing is that they all have a plot of sorts to hang the gags onbr br the recent trend seems to be to take scenes from various movies then try and spoof them as a result the socalled plot of these movies very rarely exist another flaw these movies have is that some of the scenes were actually funny in the original versions and in most cases even funnier than the spoof scene the cast try to get into the spirit required but with a lot of unfunny dialog and scenes its hard to get worked up about itbr br as recent spoof movies go its not as bad as epic movie date movie or the awful meet the spartans but considering that some people involved here have made good funny movies in the past its nowhere near good enough
