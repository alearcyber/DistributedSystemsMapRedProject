NEG compared to director kevin connors later arabian adventure this is a masterpiece however thats not saying much in fact at the earths core is a silly fantasy adventure in which peter cushing  who appears to be on something strong  and some other actor whom i dont know use a giant digging machine called the iron mole dig their way down to the earths core  only to find that the inside of the earth is pink and populated by apelike creatures who have enslaved the humans theres also a giant bird that controls the apes by means of telepathy and we get to see it blink its eyes in closeup throughout the film most importantly cushing and whatshisname also encounter the lovely caroline munro in the subterranean caves and heres what ive really got against this little flick why oh why is it that whenever munros in a movie she only gets approx  minutes of screen time in the spy who loved me maniac dracula ad  golden voyage of sinbad  always shes in the background how can kevin connor possibly think that wed rather listen to peter cushings fake accent and look at some ridiculous apeman whose voice sounds like a scratched cd than gaze at the beautiful munro i dont get it please somebody direct a movie where this english brunette is onscreen all the time
