POS i didnt know what to expect  i only watched it on a rainy sunday afternoon on pay tv  right from the start it drew me in  the music and settings and characters were excellent  i hadnt heard of any of the actors but they all were outstanding  a wonderful thriller br br now that ive read other comments on this movie referring to past versions and the book  i will be endeavouring to find out more on this great movie
