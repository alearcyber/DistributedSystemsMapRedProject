POS i saw this movie alone when i was an early teen in my hometown in india at a time when the only thing that fascinated me aside from girls were tigers i came home after watching it with a glazed look in my eye wanting to be that bloke in the movie that befriended the tigers what a movie and what a moment that was the theatre i saw it in does not exist any and has given way to a shopping mall i dont know how id feel about it now after so many years and do not want to spoil a childhood memory by finding this movie available on dvd or something similar and not finding it interesting anymore i have learned from previous experience that a childhood memory is often tarnished when one travels lifes jaded highways occasionally trying to rediscover their unadulterated past by way of movies only to find its gushing innocence completely soppy and not welcome anymore and i do not want to throw away the experiences of a memory of this movie into the wind i do not have kids so i probably am being selfish in leaving this movie in a sepia toned area of my brain not wanting it on dvd but if you are at a precocious age and want to recollect in later years memories of an endearing childhood try to watch this filmif you can ever itll be really worth it
