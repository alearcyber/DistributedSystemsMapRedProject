NEG snake island is one of those films that whilst one sits and watches its amazing level of stupidity makes one wish the film camera had never been invented the real reason why plan  from outer space will hold onto its honoured title of worst film of all time for a while to come is not so much because of how bad it is it is because of the fact that it is the most entertaining bad film you will ever see snake island is the other kind of bad snake island is just so bad that it is excruciating a stupid premise combines with a script that was written by monkeys tapping onekey typewriters onto transparencies that were then overlapped in order to resemble dialogue to make the most obvious problems here filmed entirely on location in south africa the environments in which the film takes place are about the only element that can truthfully be considered wellrealised many shots involving snakes consist of closeups so surreal in appearance that one begins to wonder whether said snakes are cgi puppets or real snakes that have been fed really hard drugsbr br william katt stars if you can call it that as an author traveling to an island resort on what appears to be a river ferry coming along with him is an assortment of very generic poorlydefined characters it is all a matter of random screen writing as to who survives to the end but katt certainly appears to be contemplating firing his agent the rest of the cast seem to be from the home and away acting school where any contemplation of an unpleasant plot point is accompanied by openmouthed gaping and darting ones eyes about in every direction the foley effects are often worse with one memorable scene where a doublebarreled shotgun sounds like the rather flat sound effects that used to accompany gunshots in such games as bioforge meanwhile snakes continually explode or jump about at random it would have been more accurate to call the film snake holocaustbr br of course no zgrade horror or scifi film is complete these days without gratuitous scenes of nubile women in a state of undress as every woman in the cast almost gets their clothes off the film starts to become less snake island and more snake island orgy but like all the worst piles all there really is in this case is a lot of setup with no real payoff the sex scenes never eventuate and the deaths of characters are so flat so uninteresting that the entire film becomes pointless unless you consider watching william katt running through a muggy forest wearing illfitting cricket gear and smashing snakes in all directions with a cricket bat a payoff for the record i dont i used to think that anaconda was the worst film ever made about predatory snakes i was so very very wrong at least anaconda had a snake one could be afraid of if they suspended disbelief for quite some time some of the snakes shown killing the human cast are no bigger than the shoelaces from some pairs of combat boots i have wornbr br so we so far have the checklist for bad horror films running along nicely the unrecognisable lame cast are accounted for as are poor audio and visual effects the dialogue is so wretched so illtimed that i have seen better writing and delivery during some of the school plays i have acted in many moons ago unfortunately where snake island falters in this respect is the area fatal to all bad films in essence it forgets to be so bad that it is funny it is so bad that it stops being good after the opening credits and becomes painful the second that the cast start to speak compared to william katts performance in snake island jon voights performance in anaconda was as oscarworthy as russell crowes in gladiator not that voight or katt are necessarily bad actors but with material like this youre hardpressed to say a single word naturally listening to some of the lines here was like being the victim of a violent crime ones mind tends to blank out the experience primary as a selfdefense mechanismbr br because of the aforementioned failure to be entertainingly bad i gave snake island a two out of ten my special score for films that are so bad they cannot possibly be good but not bad enough to entertain it is all just so boring or pointless that one might as well be watching the test pattern the proper way to spell crap is snakeisland
