POS nothing dull about this movie which is held together by fully realized characters with some depth to them even the hooded torturers have body language jannings performance is brilliant all will want and need a henry viii as he must have been henny porten is maybe nobler and purer than anne boleyn but she plays the part as written a victim caught in the jaws of a big huge babybr br sparkuhls cinematography is gorgeous in the restoration the tints sensuous lubitsch lets these characters breathe and reveal their corruption down to the tiniest of meannesses he takes his time which can try the patience of an audience accustomed to being carried away by action but the time is worth spending slow your heartbeat and watch this minor miracle of german silent film
