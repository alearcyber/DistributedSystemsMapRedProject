POS as talkshows go larry king live is not bad and since he occasionally gets good guests its a show to turn on once in awhile but not compulsively when bill maher carl bernstein a former president or other substantive guests sit across from him its not too bad other times he tends to host guests involved in the latest celebrity scandal which contributes absolutely no intelligent information to the country and feeds a largely uneducated public that wants to hear the latest gossip about movie and tv stars during the oj simpson trial it seemed like every other guest on his show was related to the case but is this really journalism or the national enquirer on the tube sometimes it comes off a little bit like trash televisionjerry springer in a sit down interview with phone calls instead of a live audiencebr br on the other side kings show is definitely much better than bill oreilly whose show is nothing more than a rightestpolitical platform of the rush limbaugh variety that said larry king is not a bad interviewer but alas he is not a great one king does not always come off like he completely comprehends when intellectual material is being presented especially if it is by a scholar or historian with a new book on subtle aspects of politics always seems like the minute king cant quite deal with the issue at hand thats when he turns to the phone calls maybe hoping someone out in the country will have a better question than he has he might interview someone like david gergen but may not have read any of his books sort of like the movie producer that never bothers to read the scriptbr br when its an entertainment celebrity no problem he can come off like hes thoroughly knowledgeable since the material is not that substantive anyway talking to elizabeth taylor about her relationship with richard burton is not exactly rocket science and i notice he usually has seen the stars latest movie watching a movie takes much less time and contemplation than reading a book however if its the likes of john dean or bob woodward king comes off a little like he didnt quite finish his homework so off to the phonesbr br if you are looking for real indepth interviewing terry gross of npr is probably the best interviewer in the united states she reads andor researches everything written by or about her guests beforehand and has a working knowledge of those areas i dont see king quite doing that granted he probably has an audience  times larger than terry gross which may say more about the american audience than king in short larry is better than bill but not as good as terry
