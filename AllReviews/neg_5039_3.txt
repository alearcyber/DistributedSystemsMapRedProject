NEG to this day malcolm mclaren is telling anyone daft enough to believe him that the sex pistols were his idea and that the band members were his puppets to be used to make him money there is a good reason for him doing this namely that he is a liarbr br here are some real factsbr br  mclaren was actually approached by the band to be manager not the other way roundbr br  the pistols were a proper organic band and not created by mclaren or anyone else jones and cook were childhood friends rotten and vicious went back a long way too this is something that has led to unfair criticism of the pistols down the years as they have been likened to manufactured boy bandsbr br  the band and no one else wrote the songs recorded them played live created the publicity and gave the interviewsbr br  mclaren did not instigate the bill grundy incident the pistols only appeared on the programme because queen had pulled out according to the band mclaren was cowering in the back in case arrests were about to be madebr br  johnny rotten walked out of the band he was not sackedbr br  far from outwitting the sex pistols john lydon rotten actually successfully sued him in the s for control and a considerable sum of money some of the evidence used by lydons lawyers was from mclarens boasting in the great rock  roll swindle this would suggest that mclaren is none too bright despite his affectationsbr br  the sackings and subsequent pay offs from a  m and emi were again not engineered it was merely the way things panned outbr br  mclaren boasts about the money he made from the band if he had been competent he could have made a great deal more it seems he coudnt even organise gigs properlybr br  mclarens claim at the start of the film that he invented punk rock can be disproved in about ten seconds the pistols were not the first punk band merely the most high profilebr br this is a terrible film the only parts worth watching are the genuine footage of the band later put to much better use in the filth and the fury
