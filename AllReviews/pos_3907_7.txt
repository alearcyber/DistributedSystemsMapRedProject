POS i believe that this is one of elizabeth montgomerys best performances in a movie and i have seen most of her moviesi saw this for the first time on television when i was around fourteen and i was so scaredi watch this movie every now and then and i still enjoy it very muchi know that these days that this movie would probably not scare people too muchthat just goes to show that the public movie and television audience has seen too much graphic violence in the last thirty years or soi love movies that do not show the graphic details you let your imagination do the work for you the cast in this movie was top notch jess walton who played the sister in the story was very good even though her part was rather small she also played in a terrific made for television thriller around the same time called youll never see me again with david hartmani got the biggest kick out of eileen heckarts performance as the housekeeper eileen was so good as a lady with a very bad dispositiongeorge maharis who played the husband was quite effectivethis story obviously had a lot of so called mistakes in the plot but i love the movie anyway i highly recommend this movie to people who love a good thriller without graphic violencei gave this movie a vote of seven
