NEG let me begin with a personal note as a film and television buff more on the enjoyment side of life i love what james woods can do and has done and i always love melanie griffith and natasha wagner was very good in this awful miserable stinking true crime essaybr br whoever really wrote this film apparently never spent any time talking to real criminals with real criminal talents yes some thieves are junkies but they have very short careers as thieves truly successful thieves are seldom caught because they dont do junk or any drugs before going on a score  job br br the james woods character was true to this paradigm in the beginning of this film and then the script fell apart completely he turns into a raging alcoholic lunatic  nice work for a highstrung guy like woods maybe but not in the least bit believablebr br most criminals are lazy if they wanted to work they would workbr br these people in this film are beautiful selfindulgent drugaddled narcissistic losers they couldnt pull off a real score in the real world the real world where a big and beefy security guard who beats the living hell out of a skinny kid  as happens in the early scenes of this dog  keeps him beat down and doesnt let him up everbr br how many ways did i find to hate this film  many even totally vulgar people  like most sneak thieves and junkies  have a larger vocabulary than these cretins and the ripoff scenes with the neonazi bikers  puhlease all rednecks aint neonazis and those who are neonazi speed dealers just aint that dumb br br this film earned a two because natasha wagner was extremely good in her role as rose and because melanie griffith still has that something special or at least she had it for this brutal and offensively stupid film im not one to sing praises of real criminals for any reason but the reality of these criminal types in this horrible film is that theyd all be dead or in jail by act  scene  watching a lousy zombie movie would be time better spent than this  thing  and i hate zombies
