NEG in this horrible attempt at a blair witch mockumentary a bunch of people go to africa to investigate a creature called the halfcaste its pretty obvious that there was no script to speak of and that everything was improvised that can work if you have good actors which this film didnt br br this movie tries to gain points for originality by exploring a more obscure myth and an exotic culture as a result there are a lot of scenes out in the bush where characters do quirky african stuff like eating elephant dung there is also some pretty good footage of lions eating from a national geographic perspective but theres not a single scare in the whole movie br br if youve seen cannibal holocaust or the blair witch project this movie will hold no surprises for you and you can probably watch better lion footage on the discovery channelbr br definitely a half aste effort br br a note to the filmmakers guys do us all a favor and next time save the how i spent my african vacation home movie for your family and close friends nobody else wants to see it
