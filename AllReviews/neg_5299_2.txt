NEG get shorty out of sight jackie brown and even  pickupfolks were finally getting elmore leonard right making good movies out of his work so despite my students warnings about how bad this movie would be i couldnt resist renting it i thought how bad can it be oy what a mistake especially right on the heels of reading the book which was lame and too circularly selfreferential too relative to the rest of elmore leonards books still the book was better than the movie leonard again trumps the weak and unskilled screenwriters who try to take over his book the dialogue written for steven tyler was painful to watch and the lyrics to the character linda moons first song my middleschoolers write with more depth sad sad sad why even give it a star because harvey keitel and uma thurman are still fun to see on screen and andre  didnt make a complete fool of himself
