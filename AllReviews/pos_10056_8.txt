POS i havent been a fan of madonna for quite sometime now however i thought i would comment on this filmbr br this film mistaken one of them as well as madonna was panned by the critics they were highly mistaken and many potential viewers were turned off by the bad reviewsbr br first madonna does an excellent job in this movie which was one of her first she plays a ditsy blonde in the film she is far from a ditsy blonde in real life most critics were somewhat prejudiced by her singing fame and didnt give her a fair shake when you view this film i hope that you understand that the accent and the goofiness is just acting she was absolutely hysterical as was the filmbr br griffen dunne is another person who was not given a fair review in the film if you take a look at his filmography you will see he is quite an accomplished actorbr br as far as the movie itself this is something similar to pretty woman but came  years before the roberts gere success its a goofball comedy with lots of site gags slapstick and one liners some of the comedy is deadpan and takes a comedy aficionado to really appreciate the more subtle humorbr br i know this doesnt tell you much about the movie however i hope this helps dispel any belief that this is a poor movie it is absolutely worth renting for an enjoyable night of great funbr br peacebr br gary
