NEG director  lead actor dutcher revels in this lookatme film wherein he attempts to gain worldly acceptance for tarnishing the otherwise very upbeat world of mormon missionaries some of the acting is fair but some roles are unrealistic ie the ominous rather than fatherly mission president etc the film does give a fair look at how some missionaries may struggle with their faith but the actual missionary program he claims to represent is far from his concept of it in terms of being upbeat cohesive and inspired the only inspiration i see in this film is dutchers selfinspiration the film is slow and boring and the shooting and screenplay look like a college student project
