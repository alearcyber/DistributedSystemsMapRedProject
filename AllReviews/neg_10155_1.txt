NEG o boy was this really badbr br i saw this on videotapebr br in scenes that had soundtrack music it was hard to hear the dialog when people were on the telephone it was hard to hear the person on the other end it appeared that at least two different kinds of film or video stock were used because the colors and focus sometimes shifted drastically between edits and there were a lot of out of focus shots that didnt seem intentionalbr br one indicator of the budget one of many was when a news report comes on tv there is just a news flash title card badly superimposed with a video effect onto a tv screen and a voiceover by a newscaster they couldnt shoot footage of a newscaster and then actually show it on the tvbr br the movie starts off with a killer wearing surgical scrubs and mask wielding a scalpel supposedly hes a paranoid schizophrenic who escapes from the hospital to avoid having a lobotomy performed on himbr br students are let out of school for a break and three young women decide to have a slumber party three guys decide to crash the party and a geek named science decides to crash it too the slumber party is pretty boring and the guys just keep showing up randomly wearing masks taking the masks off and then disappearing the mother and father the surgeon who was to do the lobotomy of one of the girls keep showing up too the killer knocks slices peoples throats without anyone really noticing the apparent lead of the movie more or less sleepwalks through the movie perhaps that was bad acting or maybe it was intentional since much of the movie is a nightmare and some of it a nightmare within a nightmarebr br the ending is really horrible toobr br the best thing about the movie is the cheesy united home video vhs box art which was revived for the dvd release a double feature with terror at tenkiller i honestly cant tell if it is a photo or a painting or a combination of both the women pictured on the cover are not in the movie and the clothing theyre wearing is way more revealing than anything the women in the movie wore the throat slicing on the cover is scarier than the ones in the movie  where people tend to affect a goofy popeyed look for that matter thats what the killer has most of the time head cocked and eyes bugging out mugging for the camera frequently the scalpel was held up close to the camera in focus while the killers maskcovered face was in closeup but out of focus in the background
