POS i saw anatomy years ago  dubbed at a friends house i dont remember it much and then i saw at the video store there is a second one  not really related to the first one franka ponte makes a little cameo and that one was okay not as good as the first one im seeing the first one again tonight  not dubbed collectors edition i really like german movies like this one its very interesting and people and cults like the one in the movie could exist i think i dunno but its very grossly entertaining and scary anatomy  is a little different and the characters are not as good as the first but if you really thought anatomy was interesting and good you should see the second one
