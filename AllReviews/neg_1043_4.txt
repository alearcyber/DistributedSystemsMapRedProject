NEG karen and her boyfriend jerry move into their new los angeles apartmentthey discover an old brass bed that karen takes a liking tounfortunately it has a really sinister history involving kinky sex murdersdeathbed tries to be a creepy supernatural talebut fails miserablythe action is slowthe acting is nothing special and there is no suspense whatsoevereven the sex scenes are lamethe climax is pretty gory and violentso fans of splatter should be pleasedhowever the first hour of deathbed is deadly dull and offers some tired horror movie conventions and cheap scaresdefinitely one to avoidmy rating  out of  and thats being generouswatch reanimator or castle freak instead
