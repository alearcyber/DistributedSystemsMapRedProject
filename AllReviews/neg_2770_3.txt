NEG my question is what was the worst element of this movie was it the acting directing script maybe it was the waste of alan ladd and jack larue larue and especially ladd are capable of bringing extreme sinisterness to a role in this movie it was hard to tell who the bad guy was granted ladd was playing an undercover good guy but even in his good guy roles he could be very chilling so the net result was a potentially good movie bereft of any feeling of conflict
