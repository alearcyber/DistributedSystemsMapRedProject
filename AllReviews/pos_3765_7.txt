POS it took me a while to find this movie since they dont have it yet on dvd and my vcr is not worth hooking up again i guess all the referencing to drug use is too much for some folks but i found a decent bootleg on ebay and i must say that anyone who takes this movie too seriously is just retarded it is a slap stick spoof in the vein of airplane i must say that when i watched it on showtime or spotlight growing up in the s i enjoyed the humor a whole lot more then than i do now but its definitely worth watching just to see what theyie movie makers were able to get away with before the just say no hypocrites unleashed their propaganda singwe are all on drugs hahaha its a silly film and worth the  i paid off of ebay to get it on dvd just dont even think about comparing it to the original  thats just plain stupid what are you high
