NEG this film fails on every count for a start it is pretentious striving to be significant and failing miserably the script was banal in the extreme nobody at any time said anything remotely interesting it was impossible to care about any of the characters knightly was a selfregarding waste of time whilst sienna miller was just a waste of time the bit about the soldier who went off to war was a clich even before the film atonement used it the use of the second world war as a backdrop was in itself a clichthe bombs the sheltering in tube stations etcemployed to import a bit of muchneeded drama why anybody thought for a moment that this film was worth making is quite beyond my comprehension it was yet another case of lets get the costumes looking authentic never mind about the story the script or the acting
