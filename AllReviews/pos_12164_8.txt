POS i had never read much about or even seen stills of the sixman british comedy group the crazy gang but my positive experiences with their contemporaries will hay and arthur askey  and especially graham greenes high praise of the frozen limits itself the funniest english picture yet producedit can bear comparison with safety last and the general  made me take the plunge with the barebones r dvds from network of this and their subsequent film gasbags  see below both of which were released earlier this year with virtually no fanfarebr br a britishmade western is a rarity but a british western spoof is rarer still carry on cowboy  was still some  years away incidentally going back to the silent classics mentioned by greene the film seems to me to be more obviously indebted to the gold rush  and way out west  besides it also plays like a variation on the snow white and the seven dwarfs fairytale which had just been immortalized on the screen via walt disneys animated masterwork and where the seventh member is played by ancient comic and frequent will hay foil moore marriott the gang actually call pretty heroine eileen bell by that name throughout and theres even an amusing sequence with the six of them preparing to go to bed and whistling the dwarfs song from the disney film br br six comedians three sets of comedy duos flanagan  allen nervo  knox and naughton  gold may be the largest such grouping on film  though not all of their personalities emerge here my favorites were big bud flanagan looking a bit like jim backus straight man chesney allen and moustached squeakyvoiced teddy knox however bald charlie naughton often took the limelight  since hes the one on which the others always seemed to pick on still its marriott who steals the film from his very first scene  where he contrives to impersonate every official in the dilapidated theater of a ghost town a very young bernard lee is also notable as the villain of the piecebr br the ore routine between flanagan and allen actually anticipates abbott and costellos famous whos on first the film in fact hinges on a lot of wordplay for its humor  which doesnt necessarily travel especially at this juncture nevertheless there are several hilarious sequences throughout  a few of which even brought tears to my eyes the opening scene where the gang are defrocked by a band of angry creditors their dressing up as indians once they hit the yukon the gangs ruse to make everybody rich with the same piece of gold they all impersonate the sleepwalking marriott to confuse the villains a gag which may owe its origin to the marx bros hilarious mirror sequence in duck soup  the spoton theater sketch which pokes fun at hoary melodramas the surreal moment when pursued by the villains one of the gang climbs a staircase that is part of the painted scenery in the theater and especially towards the end when a group of singing mounted police gallop ever so slowly to the gangs rescue despite being egged on by the increasingly impatient ranger herobr br the thinny soundtrack and the frantic nature of the gags themselves made it hard for me to get all the jokes sometimes  subtitles would certainly have been welcome in this case the crazy gang only made five films  with the first two also being wellregarded okay for sound  and alfs button afloat  and a much later reunion though allen had by this time bowed out due to illhealth and been replaced by eddie gray called life is a circus  directed by val guest who incidentally cowrote both gang films i purchased as well as some of the aforementioned hay and askey vehicles
