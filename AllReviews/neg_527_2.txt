NEG this movie moved much too slowly for my tastethe concept of the story is refreshingly different in that it explores the family dynamics of living with a mentallyretarded family member in a way that i have not previously seen onscreenhoweverthe execution of the concept was flawedeach character was developed fully within the scene of her first appearancethen one had to endure the feeling that each character was treading water the rest of the waythat iseach character flailed about awkwardly in her interpersonal relationships with others in the moviewhich i found to be a form of emotional and social retardationi suppose this has artistic meritgiven the irony that the story centers around an intellectually retarded individual surrounded by way aboveaverage intelligence friends and familythe actinghoweverwas welldone without exceptioni agree with other reviewers that the cinematography was beautifulin summaryi think the film has strong artistic merit because of the fine acting and cinematographybut fails on an emotional level due to the shortcomings described
