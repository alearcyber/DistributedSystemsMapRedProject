POS if theres one cartoon that helped to put upa on the map more than any other its gerald mcboingboing this tale of a little boy who only speaks in sound effects has kept its charm for the last  years besides the effects loved the music the abstract animation and backgrounds the narration by marvin miller pretty much everything and it won the oscar for best animated short of  glad to have seen it on youtube after reading about this dr seuss story for so many years and rocky and bullwinkle creator bill scott also contributed how awesome hope to see the subsequent shorts made in the series if not on youtube then maybe in a dvd collection now i guess ill watch another upa short there
