NEG the reason why i gave this movie a  was for a couple reasons but this movie was not that bad first off the editing i found too be pretty poor at times the scriptor what they had of one was not very good and if not for nunzio la bianca the acting would have been crap but all that asideha ha i know its like the whole movie its not that bad for an extremely low ind  low budget film if they would have gotten more money a little better actorsbut these ones were intimidating so it was good and a little more detailed script this movie would be terrific somebody has to tell me this guy was influenced a lot by the warriors by walter hill i mean this movie is exactly like it anyone who has seen both those films will agree with me
