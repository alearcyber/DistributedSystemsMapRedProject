POS everyone wants duvall and jones back come on viewers are saying things like zahn and urban arent as deeppuhlease were you as deep when you were young thats the whole point they have a lot to learn zahn and urban pull off the shallow innocence they were directed to act and with superb commitment to preserving the nuances of duvall and jones input into the characters zahn is flagrantly perfect as the early gus and urban is subtly perfect as the early woodrow what a bold move it must have been for them to take on such a position in the entertainment industry they must have known they would have everyone coming down on them for not actually being the beloved originals yet they clearly put the best effort forward i gave it a  because the editing was choppy in places and timelines were sketchy but the acting was a joy to watch val kilmer was absolutely great one more thing i expect audiences would have been more accepting of the mysticism implied by the appearances of a jaguar and blue and gold macaw if more effort had been put into the way they appear and are so simply accepted by the characters
