NEG the other lowestrating reviewers have summed up this sewage so perfectly there seems little to add i must stress that ive only had the cockney filth imposed on me during visits from my children who insist on watching the sunday omnibus my god its depressing like all soaps it consists entirely of totally unlikeable characters being unpleasant to each other but its ten times as bad as the next worst one could be the reviewer who mocked the true to life bilge spouted by its defenders was spoton if anyone lived in a social environment like this theyd slash their wrists within days and i can assure anyone not familiar with the real east end that its rather more ethnically enriched than youll ever see here take my advice  avoid this nadir of the british tv industry it is evil
