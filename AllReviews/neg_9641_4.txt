NEG my mistake for thinking this was a serious warishell movie prior to seeing it that all ended seconds into the film when the mtv logo appeared it might as well been called national lampoons sexynloose and it did play to the mtv crowd the movie that followed those comical first few seconds played like the music videos they used to play  years ago at least disney was smart enough to ship its rated r stuff over to touchtone and allowed us to take it seriously okay im being harsh it wasnt that bad of a film however it definitely has its share of overacting and the film is extremely biasedonesided admittedly im not a war movie buff i cant watch platoon full metal jacket or saving private ryan more than once sure they were good movies but theyre not my forte and they all seem to blend in after awhile to where i wouldnt be able to distinguish one from the next following a tour in iraq phillippe plans life after the war but is drawn back in due to a clause in his contract or at least thats the militarys plan until he goes awol and the characters speed crosscountry on a few bucks amazingly never caught no i havent been in any war nor to iraq nor do i agree with it i also dont have all the knowledge when it comes to recruitment or signing their contracts i can say this though i am sorry theyre drawn back into this conflict i cant feel too much for someone so dumb not to read the fine print its like someone on their deathbed leaning over to finally read the surgeon generals warning on their box of cigarettes and say oh theyre what deadly ill sue them
