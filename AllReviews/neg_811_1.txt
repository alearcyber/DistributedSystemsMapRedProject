NEG set in  skenbart follows a failed swedish book editor who decides to take a nonstop train to berlin unfortunately for everyone around him hes a walking disaster causing mayhem everywhere he goes the train also holds a man and his mistress scheming to murder the mans wife whos also on the train a soldier on his way home two gay elderly gentlemen an angry train conductor two nuns a bunch of refugees and even more peoplebr br meant as a mix of noirish thriller which it does quite well  at least to begin with and comedy the film fails with both it doesnt sit right as the film changes tone with every new scene and as the train races towards its final destination the film turns more and more bizarre ending on a truly surreal notebr br the good bits are wasted in a myriad of pointless plots and characters skenbart is packed with famous swedish actors no matter how small the part is it feels like the filmmakers rang everyone theyve ever worked with and offered them a part in the film too bad that the performances are just as bad as the script act your lines  dont read thembr br the comedy is more or less slapstick with the same jokes repeated over and over the pace is incredibly slow at times quite often actually with on scene in particular dragging on for about ten minutes for no good reason the screenwriter also seems to think that swearing is a good way to replace decent dialogue the film looks great though in moody bw but its wasted on such inept filmmaking in every other department
