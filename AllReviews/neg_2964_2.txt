NEG my wife and i both remembered this film being a lot better than it is when we rented it last weekend we wondered if we were watching the same movie we had seen  years or so ago we both agreed that we were probably remembering the tv series which in its onehour segments was compelled to actually wrap up plot lines this movie leaves many loose threads as has been mentioned by others here basically every main characters story line is left unresolvedbr br gotta like the title song though
