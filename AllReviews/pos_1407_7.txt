POS i found west point to be an agreeable film although i doubt that i would watch it again the performances were convincing with william haines as yet another obnoxiously amusing young man that has his comeuppance by films end its hard to believe that stardom beckoned joan crawford less than a year after this film was made as she looks rather awkward at times br br i would apply the comment made by another concerning ramon novarros huddle  to this film as well there is a great film waiting to be made here but there is something lacking the backdrop and integration of the corps was well utilized but i was less involved than i thought that i would be perhaps haines character went too far or got away with too much his repentance did not seem genuine enough and what kind of message did it send for him to run every play in the last minutes of the armynavy game wheres the corps in that might as well have taken out the other ten men and let him do it all himself also i doubt very much that william bakewells weak puny character would ever have a reallife counterpart at west pointbr br all this aside the film is sometimes very moving and inspiring it is a fine look into the daily practices of an honorable institution thank goodness that tradition still means something at west point too unlike the vapid traditions of ivy league schools only halfheartedly engaged in these daysbr br as to the score it was appropriately martial but there was a distinct overuse of snare drums using them for knocks on the door scene transitions et alu as well as in well over half the scenes got to be rather tedious it rather lessened the viewing experience i was ready to say i get the point already br br with that enjoy the film but dont expect too much emotional involvement
