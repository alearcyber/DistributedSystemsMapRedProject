NEG one of the worst movies ive ever seen yes i know im not the target audience target audience is females either college age or middle aged or any aged i guess im none of these so the makers dont mind if i dont like it but that wont excuse the fact that the dialogue and the plot are horrible the main character phoebe goes on a journey to europe to find out what happened to her sister faith who committed suicide phoebe is an inane character that i hope no one identifies with faith is also a character with very little believability wolf is the only person who seems to be somewhat reasonable as i said the dialogue is boring and uninteresting the plot does completely stupid things at times the absolute worst is that phoebe and faiths father is an artist but his paintings are completely dreadful there is nothing new interesting or refreshing in this movie if your a guy you will pray for the ending if your a chick you might be able to sit through it but you will be unimpressed
