NEG this has got to be one of absolute worst movies ive ever seen in my life the writing and acting are just pathetic it ranks right up there with uncle sam on the all time worst movies ever made however when i see crap like this able to make it to video it really inspires me to pursue my wild dreams of making films because i know i could do a better job than what the makers of killers did
