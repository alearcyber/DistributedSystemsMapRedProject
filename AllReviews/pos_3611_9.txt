POS captain corellis mandolin is a fantastic film in itself it is nothing like the book which may disapoint its ardent followers yet viewed on its own the film is a masterpiece the views are spectacular and the acting isnt too bad either nicolas cage was brilliantso different from his usual action hero type characters penelope cruz is superb and really holds the film together i think that this film has to be judged as an indivdual projectnot related to the book louis de bernieres gave up rights to the film script so the film is an interpretation of the director john maddon go and see this film with an open mindyoull love it because underneath is the touching story of love and war
