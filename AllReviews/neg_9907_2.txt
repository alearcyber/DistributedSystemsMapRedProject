NEG the only reason i know this film exists is because i wanted to see what nancy mckeon had been up to since the facts of life ended when i searched her name up came this relatively new tv movie after much investigation i managed to locate a copy  was thoroughly disappointed with what i viewed d grade acting poor script terrible fx  it was like watching a toned down more stupefied version of day after tomorrow that went for  hours despite the long running time the characters remain fairly underdeveloped we do not care about them in the slightest  in most cases are longing for their demise combine that with terrible lighting  cinematography  you have a real disaster of a film how they conviced so many name actors ie dianne weist randy quaid brian dennehy to appear in such trash is mindblowing in summary  i want those  hours of my life back
