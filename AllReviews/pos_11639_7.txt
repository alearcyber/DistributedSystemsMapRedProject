POS while it may not be his most laughpacked film mighty like a moose stands as one of charley chases most satisfying farce comedies twenty minutes of clever sight gags nicely choreographed physical comedy and amusing quips rendered via title card of course all based on a wacky and wildly implausible premise were told up top that this is a story of homely people a wife with a face that would stop a clock and her husband with a face that would start it again soon we meet bucktoothed charley moose and his wife vivien who has an enormous nose but theres no point in discussing plausibility when our plot hinges on such a patently unbelievable series of interconnected coincidences ie first that charley would have his overbite corrected the very day his wife would have her nose fixed second that each spouse would keep their respective cosmetic surgeries secret from the other and third that when bumping into each other in public afterward charley and vivien wouldnt recognize each other sounds like a bit of a stretch doesnt it multiple stretches is more like it clearly were in the world of farce here and just have to roll with the silly plot twists so as long as you can relax and forget about plausibility youre likely to enjoy this shortbr br mighty like a moose gets off to a leisurely start as the various complications of the story are established but things pick up once charley and vivien have met and made a date to attend a party together at the home of charleys dentist they each rush home excitedly enter separately and are at first unaware of each others presence mr  mrs moose appear to be quite wealthy incidentally as they live in a mansion the size of a luxury hotel there follows a beautifully timed sequence somewhat reminiscent of buster keatons the navigator in which husband and wife dash about the house without ever quite meeting up facetoface and once they arrive at the party the comedy really kicks into high gear as charley is forced to dance with gawky wallflower gale henry henry an estimable player in her own right who starred in many short comedies dating back to  is hilarious as the dance partner who brings great vigor but little grace to her dancing theres also an elegant cinematic touch during this sequence when the camera pans down to show us only the shoes of charley gale vivien and viviens dance partner yet were able to follow precisely whats happening between the principles by watching their feetbr br unfortunately for charley and vivien the party theyre attending is raided and from there on the complications multiply when they manage to escape the police dragnet and return home when charley realizes that his newlyprettified wife was attempting to step out with another man he resolves to each her a lesson    while conveniently forgetting of course that he was attempting to do the very same thing the last few minutes of this film offer some of chases funniest physical comedy capped with a good sight gag for the punchline mighty like a moose leaves the viewer with a warm glow and surely ranks with the most amusing comedies produced by the prolific sadly underrated charley chase
