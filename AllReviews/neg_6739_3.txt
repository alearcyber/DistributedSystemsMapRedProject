NEG when you watch a seagal movie you expect good action you expect fighting not just a lot of shooting like in this flick and you expect a rather simple story ok i can live with a more complex story even though its a seagal movie but this one this is i dont know what to say its very very confusing indeed at the end of the movie i had major problems figuring out what had happened and i know im not the only one the story lacks so much information and is so full of plot holes that its nearly impossible to keep track of whats happening in the movie there are many people in the movie people change sides all the time and it switches locations too often terrible i just dont understand why it looks like seagal is making a sort of sequel to this one
