NEG i saw this film in the theater when it first came out im sorry to say and it was one of only a few films i have ever wanted to walk out of early i didnt have a problem with the drug content and i could see how this cautionary tale could have been powerful the problem was the filmmaker working with james woods and sean young drew two of the least lovable characters i have ever seen on film i hated this pair and couldnt have cared less if they sunk straight to the inevitable bottom their was not one surprise in this film every turn of events was so painfully obvious that i felt i could have written the script myself although i like to think i would have done a better job i subsequently heard nightmarish stories about the incidents on the set between sean young and james woods along the lines of some sort of stalking events it made me wonder if the terrible acting arose out of some bad feelings and dysfunction anyway i refer to the boost as the worst film ive ever paid money to see
