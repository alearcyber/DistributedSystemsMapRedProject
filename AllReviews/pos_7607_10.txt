POS i love this movie it focuses on both issues reality and fantasy reality because hey we all wanted a date from that popular guy billy and some of us havent been kissed yet right be honestbr br another real issue is because of the pain people gain from teasing and whoa high school life remember it the fantasy is finding your true love when youre  and still in high school not really fantasy but close enoughbr br although some parts are unbelievable it was a great movie there are no other words to describe such incredible work and the story was wonderful drew barrymore did a charmingly wonderful job same as the hilarious david arquette the people who worked in the movie are all wonderful didnt i just repeat thatbr br never been kissed is one of the movies that the later generations should watch it shows reality and somenot issues for people like you and me
