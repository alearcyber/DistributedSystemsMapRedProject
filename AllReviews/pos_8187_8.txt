POS i enjoyed the film very much especially the performance of the exceptionally beautiful gong li as the concubinebr br it was a little distracting however to have chinese dialogue plus english subtitles plus americanaccented voiceover even though the voice over was very well synchronisedbr br qin shi huiang dis the first emperor of qinsfamily name was zheng and his given name yiong so in the english he should have been referred to as king zheng or emperor zheng and not as king ying zheng as in those days the two familygiven names were not used togetherbr br the state of qin is pronounced chin not shin  a pity the researchers didnt get this rightbr br i forgave this but was dismayed at the end when the commentary announced that he was buried at zaian together with his terra cotta warriors the town xian is pronounced seean  never zaian surely the american voiceover speakers could have got that right
