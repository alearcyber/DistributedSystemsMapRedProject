NEG this little cheapy is notable only because it is the worst film abbott and costello ever made it is dreadful in every way crummy music horrid choreography check out the awkward lead male dancer cheesy special effects and sets wooden actors the leads are barely at the high school level in their profession and were unheard of later and a script without a single laugh better times were ahead for the comedy duo abbott and costello meet captain kidd is much preferable as is the television series which at times was inspired but skip this one
