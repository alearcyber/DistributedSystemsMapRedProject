POS its not hard to imagine what the main problem for a screenwriter is who wants to have  equally well written characters with about the same amount of screen time in a movie that last around  minutes its almost impossible not to fall back on stereotypes and that is also what writerdirector ralf westhoff does here very few of the characters can be recognized as people that you and me know in real life many of them are just characterized with two or three attributes and stay vague i am aware of that but still think that shoppen is successful namely that it accomplishes just what it wants to it is a film with very well written dialogue extremely good acting and a film that made me laugh out loud really often i dont think that this film wants to make a deep going analysis of loneliness in our modern society or that it wants to be moral commentary on speeddating its a movie about something that exists and people and their motivation to use it funny and entertaining
