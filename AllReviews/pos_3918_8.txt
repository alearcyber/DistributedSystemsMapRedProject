POS this is one of the best horror  suspense films that hollywood has made in years or maybe even decadeseven though in my opinion this movie was predictable in parts it has everything that a good film in this genre should had chill thrills and yes a lot of gore house of wax sure delivers in parts it was sort of farfetchedthe acting was not that greatbut my overhaul rating for house of wax is an eight out of tenif you enjoy being at the edge of your seats this is just the right movie for youi have to admitit was sort of neat seeing the whole town made out of wax i myself enjoy these museums but after seeing this film i will now look at them in a whole new different way
