NEG tired garbled dreck the chemistry between argento and madsen was as exciting as a wet doughnut their dialogue was dramatically uninteresting the storyline was a mess the acting forced the cinematography lingered on the uninspired lazy and pointless kim gordon and her character had no reason to be there nor did anyone else for that matter i couldnt have given two farts for any of the characters their emotions skipped and jumped like a junkie who hates his heroin empty and dull why do i have to write ten lines of text on here to make my point i think i summed it up in the first three words but obviously its not enough i think this is the last time ill bother to waste my time critiquing a film anyway i saw clean and thought that was quite ineffectual as well again i cared not for the characters whether they lived or died
