NEG now really can u call that a movie i knew some of the movies that japanese people do are good for nothing but this bad i mean comom i fell a sleep three times at this movie no horror at all some tiny percent  comedy action lets just admit that it has some but the scenes are poorly filmed the actors are pathetic none of the actors did a good job in its own role the were not convincing the script is also awful i mean this movie may be great really but for the sin not  sure i recommend not to see it unless you want to get so bored as i did i cant quite figure hot this movie got its rating its over over over rated this is a personal opinion of course i don want to offend anyone but who could like this crap so i hope this helps someone not to loose some time enjoying this movie nevertheless its your choice
