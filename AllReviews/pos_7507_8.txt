POS dr bock teaches at the hospital and he is quite good at it the thing about him is that he is depressed dr bock and his wife separated his children are deviant he cannot perform in the bedroom and he feels as if he isnt doing a very good job at healing people he becomes suicidal but meets barbara who changes his ideas for the better all around this story is a murder mystery and a group of angry protesters outsidebr br the movie is well done and the character of dr bock is well played out its a little sad somewhat funny and somewhat of a drama it was good to see a couple stories wrapped around the hospital even if they were somewhat unrelated to what dr bock was doing great movie
