POS john ford paid the wagons his tribute of a special picture wagon master made after two big indiancavalry epics it is a lovely poetic movie full of romanticized reincarnation of the pioneer spirit it didnt have to top the big ones that had preceded itbr br photographically it is extremely simple the camera moves only once or twice in the entire film and never when a director would have made it move to underline a shot ford even resists the temptation to track his camera in the breathtaking twilight shots of the women wearily marching along in the dust behind their wagons they comeand gowhile the camera remains immobile and the audience stays a spectator to the march of history not a participant in it of course when ford wants to involve his audience emotionally or dramatically as in stagecoach he knows just how to do it but wagon master is a tender nostalgic look backwardbr br filled with traditional western songs rendered by the sons of the pioneers it tells of the trek west to utah in  of a mormon wagon train led by ward bond in the role of elder wiggs and two young horse traders ben johnson and harry carey jr and in a series of beautiful images as the wagon train fights outlaws indians and nature in its struggle to reach the promised land the modest wagon master manages to capture the history and legend of the west br br ford himself has said that wagon master of which he wrote the original story was among the three films of his which came closest to being what i had wanted to achievebr br fords career as a western director was astonishing more than anyone else he was able to use the genre to protect his feelings about the family society and the american way of life ford saw the frontier as a land to be subdued by a special class of settlers and lawmen whose great sacrifices make the land safe from those who come after these early westerners were giants who deserved the legendary status they earned and the civilized townsfolk who followed must always hold them in fear and respect fords westerns often employ flashbacks that emphasize the historical authenticity of his approachbr br in wagon master for example folk songs on the sound track tell us of the hardships of the pioneers of a century ago and ford shows them to us in almost documentary fashion in one sequence the train is camped in a circle and the settlers decide to hold a square dance to fashion a dance floor they have to lay boards over the desert sand and with this ritual celebration ford shows the defeat of the wilderness through the metaphor of boarding over the landbr br its a lovelytolookat film full of a marvelous lighthearted optimism and it is easy to understand why ford found it so satisfying it never breaks faith with the mood and style set in the first few sequences but one is left wondering whether the ultraromantic best suits the chosen themebr br the wagontrain experience must have been one of the most physically demanding and nervewracking ordeals that man with his womankind ever set himself it must have been riddled with doubtswas i wrong to sell up everything and come how can we hope to survive how will we contend the other endalmost every other aching step of the waybr br yet none of this feeling really comes through in wagon master the journeysuch is the general ebulliencedoes not strike one as particularly hazardous it could be of course that the mormons were so high on religious spirit that this tended to act as an anesthetic in other words their reactions werent those of normal human weakness if so ford was right and the doubters were wrongbr br what is beyond doubt is the right and proper ebullience especially at first meeting of ben johnson and harry carey jr this is the essence of lighthearted adventurous youth particularly one feels of western youth of those extraordinary times its a remarkable relationship and it remains lodged in the mind
