POS footprints certainly isnt your average run of the mill giallo and thats no bad thing unlike his previous effort the fifth cord which was your classic giallo luigi bazzonis film forsakes almost all of the giallo trademarks and instead of murder the focus is very on psychological mystery its obvious from the outset that this is going to be an entirely bizarre film as the film opens up with a scene set on the moon things dont get any clearer after that as the lunar sequence turns out to be the dream of alice a troubled woman alice is tormented by dreams of an astronaut stranded on the moon which have apparently come from a viewing of a film called footprints on the moon after several things go wrong for her alice decides to go to a mostly deserted former tourist spot named garma upon her arrival she is surprised as the people she meets seem to already know her alice also meets a young red headed girl who also seems to already know her the girl tells alice she looks exactly like nicole except nicer and with shorter hairbr br the fact that footprints doesnt feature much in the way of sex murder and other giallo trademarks puts it somewhat on the back foot with its primary audience from the beginning as most people going into this film arent going to get what they were expecting or probably wanted but on the other hand footprints commands respect for the fact that it doesnt just follow on from what went before it by  the giallo had started to lose its popularity and many of the films coming out around this period with a few very notable exceptions were merely retreads of what came before so luigi bazzoni would have been taking a big chance on this film florinda bolkan gives a strong performance in the lead role and the fact that shes not the prettiest giallo heroine isnt really important the mystery builds nicely throughout and while it can become a little turgid at times footprints is generally speaking intriguing for the duration it probably wont come as a surprise to many once they get there that the ending doesnt make much sense and doesnt really clear anything up but it nicely adds to the bizarre cult value of the film and all in all i give footprints a thumbs up
