POS this is a made for tv movie by hallmark hallmark has always made quality movies that are family orientated just desserts is a boy and girl fall in love while working together movie two bakers competeing for a  prize against a field of professional bakers it is fun and light hearted the desserts look great the movie has a catchy upbeat little song played during the competition i assume that it is a made for the movie song by roger bellon to bad that no soundtrack is available i would really like to get a copy of the song i dont even know the name of the song because the credits are squished at the end of the movie to make room for hundreds of promos anyway the cast is great it is always nice to see brenda vaccaro she is very bubbly and upbeat lauren holly is always a plus and costas mandylor rounds out the good guys with a wonderful performance professional chef wolfgang puck has a guest appearance the movie is worth watching
