NEG first and foremost i take issue to the title of this movie chupacabra is not a spanish word the name to which they are referring is chupacabras i imagine they dropped the s because it sounds plural that way but i assure you it is singular in spanishbr br next i thought this movie had been done years ago it came off as one of those b horror flicks i watched when i was an early teenager at home when my stepdad was out of town then it would have been kind of scarybr br lets talk about the special effects the most important effect is the costume used for the chupacabras given that it is the main character you would think some serious money would have been put into it but that isnt so the shape color and texture were all goofy like some stupid haunted house at disney worldbr br there were times when the chupacabras was walking where no man could walk his movement were jerky and strange at these times but moving around on the floor looked like any normal manbr br another thing i take issue to is that there is no animal in the world that goes around slaughtering everything it sees with no regard to actually eating it the chupacrabas would kill one then the next but it never seemed to actually eat the victim you say its just a movie and i agree but the idea is so far out there that its stupidbr br what country is dr pena from he sounds sort of jamaincanhawaiianbritishsomethingelse but i think hes supposed to be latino the problem is his accent is so bad that even a russian could tell he wasnt latinobr br the soldiers fired round after round at this thing and werent making a dent yet the continued to fire im no military man but dont soldiers especially the special tactical forces such as this have to have some wit about them to perform their duties wouldnt they figure out that it was a waste of time to shoot and try something new they didnt they just kept firing away while the chupacabras continued to slaughter and not eat thembr br did they have to kill the little dog  anyway my vote was  for this flick because it was bad why did i watch the whole thing im sure youve done the same on occasion so dont give me an flack
