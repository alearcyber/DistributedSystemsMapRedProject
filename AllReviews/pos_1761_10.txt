POS hoppity goes to town was the second and last full length animated feature made by max and dave fleischer who created a parallel universe to disney while disneys films are well remembered today both of the fleischer films gullivers travels and this one are forgottenbr br hoppity is a spellbinding original not an adaptation like the first picture that is a major plus one would think no the critics rarely on the fleischers sides to begin with tore into them for this yes the story is not as tight as gulliver but how can you hate a film that flaunts itself so joyfullybr br it is filled with great musical numbers and a very involving story which would be a crime to reveal the characters are lovable and charming and there is heart in this filmbr br the fleischers really outdid themselves here and never quite did so again most of their time would be devoted to onereelers after this tanked at the box office its a shame they didnt continue making features who knows their next attempt may have become the masterpiece they were aiming forbr br  out of  stars
