NEG decent action scenes but the movie is saddled with a slow convoluted storyline nearly nonexistent dialogue that leads to minimal character development and a seriously horrible storylinebr br did i mention that the storyline made no sense but in its defense the action scenes were impressive enough even if they leave you scratching your head as to why they just happenedbr br theres not much else to say about the movie its a slick mindless action adventure that makes no sense whatsoever its like watching a worse version of the matrix and skipping all the storyline and dialogue
