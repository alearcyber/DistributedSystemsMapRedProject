POS as with so many modern us films there has to be a supernatural element to the plot but if you just let that go this is a tale with heaps of charm and a kindly heart cased in a crab shellbr br we are presented with a scene of a town in an economically depressed area struggling to find anything to be happy about beau bridges character is really up against it with a family on the increase a nil bank balance and a brotherinlaw whos sold out to a big business chain which he secretly hates but in which he is willing to rub beaus nose donofrio finds his rather surface bubba lifestyle cramped by having to look after his blessed baby brother joey and is itching to escape the shackles of this dead hick town their bosss business is closing down much against his will because of a lack of new customers and he is haunted by memories of his father as he builds up the tension towards his own attempt at selfdestructionbr br joey who had seemed to personify the curse on their lives is lost at sea  believed drowned  in a freak accident his miraculous restoration to them by the portuguese trawlermen whose boat they had just built and launched perhaps symbolic of an angelic crew is the sign theyve been waiting for and they all decide to give life one last throw of the dicebr br there is a beautiful brooding mood throughout this work which excelled in holding our attention as brilliantly as the shipping news there are other parallels with the later work too which lead one to suspect a touch of a remake i like signs of life for its simpler less contrived story and star performances from actors working at their craft rather than to be noticed as stars
