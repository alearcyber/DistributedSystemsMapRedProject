NEG simply i just watched this movie just because of sarah  am also giving these  stars just because of heron the other side this movie was easily one of the worst movies i have ever seen theacting was horrible the script was uninspired this was a movie that kept contradicting itself the film was sloppy and unoriginal its not like i was expecting a good film just something to give me a jump or two this did not even do that br br he worst thing is that the more i think about the overall plot the less sense it actually makes and the more holes we keep finding a real shame really as im fairly sure that there was a good idea lurking in there somewherebr br im perhaps being a bit harsh giving the film a  but given the actors involved and again sara obvious writing talent this film really should have delivered far more
