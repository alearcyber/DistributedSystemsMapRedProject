POS this movie was talked about in fangoria where i heard about this it was interesting to me mostly becuase it was directtovideo and i recognized two of the stars on the cover james marsden of disturbing behavior and christine taylor from the craft and to my surprise on valentines day when i was searching through the horror aisle to find it on the shelf i immediately had to grab it me and my brother and our girlfriends watched it and to my surprise it was pretty good the tales were interesting and for once they were actually scary unlike a lot of other horror movies being made recently some of the plot i do not understand but once i watch it again i bet ill get it and to even more of my surprise there were other stars i recognized including one of the girls from the tv show my socalled life and jacinda from the real world im not sure why this movie was only directtovideo with a little advertising this movie could have at least made up for how much money was spent on making it the only problem i have is that since it wasnt released in theatres i guess ill never be able to view it in widescreen you should definitely take a chance and rent this onebr br
