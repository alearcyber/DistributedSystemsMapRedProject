POS my husband and i both loved this film at first my husband was skeptical and asked how many points he got for sitting through this one but after a few key scenes he was totally sucked in and by the end he was convinced it was one of the best movies going kathleen bates has never been so wonderfully loveable and the rest of the cast is just simply fantastic thank you for this beautiful film
