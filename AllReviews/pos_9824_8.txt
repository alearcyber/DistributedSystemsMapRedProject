POS i dont know how i would feel if i lived in usa i would watch some preview scenes advertisements i would know sidney pollack directed it harrison ford and kristin scott thomas starring in i would watch this film as soon as possible without reading any bad review would i be disappointmentbr br i read a lot of review which is said how bad this film was this is boring long film without passion emotions and it is not interesting harrison is wooden cold the sublots should be cut too serious particularly for harrison ford i am interested in the subject and i like harrison ford in the films which are not actions i like sidney pollack and kristin scott thomas too so reading the reviews on imdb website then in other sites then in february in the hungarian movie magazines i was wonder and wonder what the film was anyway there are films directors stars whatwho i want to see despite any reviewsbr br i can understand people who thinks this film is boring and cold and has got not any passion but i feel different it is true i liked sliding doors the forbidden woman this is a french film i dont know what its title in english or in french basic of these films is development of a lovebr br i think random heart is a nice and interesting film in its own waybr br it may be true that the sublots the congress election and the cops investigation after a corrupt policeman are not written well are not worked out in details but add something to the leading woman and man characterafter his wifes death and betrayal emotion angry of dutch comes to the surface during his work he will be suspicious and almost lost his best friend then the woman too the film shows two ways to survive the tragedy our wifehusbands death and cheating one of them is the womans this is tragedy but the life is continuing she doesnt want to mourn forever what she wants to knowwhat her husbands loverthe cops wife thought about her she will not learn never she is forced to behave in this way the elections are comes and anything about his husband may become scandal she wants her daughter not to be disappointment with her father the man is a cophe suffering from the fact he lived in lies he wants to know maybe every men would want to know in this situationwhen his wife started to cheat him how long had she got lover he needs the womans help but she doesnt want but the guy is stubborn and steadypersistent the woman cant stand him because he always steps into her life and she cannot forget their relationship is tense at the beginning then slowly developments a type of silent sympathy which is prefer an alliance against the outside world the tragedy i said it in spite of that they made love in bed however the cop cant stop with investigation cant stop close and cant allow the woman close to him but he starts the love and the woman wants their relationship to continue but it cant the woman realizes it the end is a bit sad but logic and nice at the same timebr br it was pleasant for me to see again peter coyotei like this mans face sidney pollack i hardly knew bonnie hunt but she was goodbr br i think harrison ford did an okay job his eardrop is unusual but at the beginning then finally i believed that the woman liked being at his company in spite of his temperament it was pity he had not got any joke but ford has got a good sense of humour a reviewer noticed in hungary ford is charismatic against his haircut and ear drop and we are waiting for his presence and would like him to smile at us and make an ironic notice but dr jones is not smiling at us but he smiles at the end and it is soooo good with the rest i agree i very like him in this role he is good in acting of this a bit rough cool but somewhere in his soul smart cop the character of kristin scott thomas is a woman who is determined self confident but she is closed inside a ivory tower and she keeps aloof from her emotions but she is a really woman who become indecisive and find support on the copthe two cool reserved people find each otherbr br maybe the script is not good it is full of common banal sentence but there are some humorous sentences from the woman and movement particularly from the man it is a good film but not for everybody not for the general big audience i watched the females under  and males above  liked this film better about the latter maybe sidney pollack made this film for his agegroup which doesnt go to multiplex anyway i advice the people who like energetic plots with action scenes who like only fords action films miss this movie
