POS i must admit that this is one of the few lou costello films that i actually saw in the theater most have now been seen on tv and i must admit that lou is really enjoyable and he gets the girltoo this was my first time seeing dorothy provine perform and of course i fell in love with her like so many others that day i have seen most of the work she has done and enjoyed each one her performance in the great race is one of the reasons i bought the disc in the first placebr br every comment on this movie tells that this is the one movie that lou costello did with out bud abbottwhich is truebut if lou had lived he would have made many more he really does a good job and doesnt have to rely on his old routines to get laughs i for one am sorry that the little man from pattersonnj didnt get the chance to do thatbr br i hope this comes out on dvd some time so i can add it to my comedysci fi collection
