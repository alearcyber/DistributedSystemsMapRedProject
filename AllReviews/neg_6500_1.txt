NEG if you are planning to schedule your program for a film festival do not be misled by what it says in the booklet this is a complete waste of time and energy i have watched bunuel i have seen dali and admired them but this isnt surrealism this is not supposed to be at all didnt they ever think about the reputation of human race while taking this picture after we become extinct by global warming these will be the remainings of our civilization what if the aliens sample this as an example of our intellectual capital with all due respect to the effort put in this maybe it would be a good idea to terminate all the copies of this film  or whatever it is
