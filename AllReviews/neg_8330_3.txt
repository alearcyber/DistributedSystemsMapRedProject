NEG well this was my first imax experience so i was pretty blown away about that primarily although with hindsight i cant help wishing that it had been some other less monochromefilmbr br magnificent desolation very much had the programme for schools feel the way it listed all the astronauts and this made it feel a lot like reading national geographic magazine in d weirdly it actually had a very two dimensional quality that only occasionally exploded into reality and a lot of time it felt like some powerpoint presentation there was a moment in the film when an unnoticed abyss opens seemingly at your feel that had a bit of a wow factor but to be honest that may have had more to do with me being an imax virginbr br the commentary provided by tom hanks i personally found very whats a nice way to put it flagwavingly nationalistic which didnt go down too well in central london judging by remarks overheard as we leftbr br over all i loved the imax experience but dearly wish a different film had been on on that day the moon isnt a particularly colourful subject and to be honest a lot of the d effects were lost in the monochrome scenery all that would have been well were it not for the documentary inserts and distractions like the interviews with american schoolchildren which spoiled it a bit
