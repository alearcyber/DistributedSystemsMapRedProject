POS im not from usa im from central europe and i think the show is amazingly good it can be easily compared with married withchildren my title says that it isnt show for conservative public i mean im not so liberal but it may be slight difference between european conservatism and us cons anyway show is starting to be very popular in our area and its very bad that it contains only two seasons last episode opens many continuous and funny moments anyway i and many peoples would be glad if that would continue playing the last thing im thrilled about this is some moral education very nice packed into humorous scenes i mean i have seen many comedies that has over two and even more minutes of very sad in tragic scenes that absolutely dont fit into comedy war doesnt contain something like that and is made for laughing its like the simpsons and married whose also dont have any sad or even unfunny moments im apologizing for my awful knowledge of english but i still hope that you will understand what i meant
