NEG i cant honestly believe that this is a sequel or follow up of john landis classic comedy horror movie from   i suppose you cant really describe it as an original werewolf movie either since the bare bones of the story steal elements from the one set in london an american tourist visits a famous european capital  he narrowly survives a werewolf attack that kills a colleague  he embarks  pardon the pun  on a sexual relationship with someone in the medical profession  he turns into a werewolf  hes visited by apparitions of his dead victims  etc etc  and reading the previous line ive just discovered how much the storyline has in common with the original that it seems very similar indeed  the difference lies in how enjoyable and entertaining the landis movie is br br with this paris based movie theres no scenes that really stand out  theres no naked man waking up in a zoo wondering how hes going to get back home with no money or clothes  theres no bizarre dream sequence of naziwerewolves and theres no spectacular climax  aawip does try to be funny but is there anything more embarrassing than failed humour  im thinking of the scene where andy mcdermott has to convince someone hes got chewing gum in his pocket and not condoms  perhaps the biggest difference between the two movies is that theres no poignancy involved with this dubious follow up  you really do feel sorry for the protagonists fate and dilemma in the london movie  here you just feel andy is nothing more than a cypher going through the literary motions of a script  theres also a large number of plot holes visible  is this the first time the lunar club have carried out a massacre  if not then arent large numbers of corpses with their hearts torn out been reported in the worlds press  why havent the police got leads br br everyone else has mentioned it and so will i  the visuals are poor  look at the bungee jumping scene at the eifell tower  its painfully obvious that its achieved via some blue screen projection while the werewolf transformation is done by some very cartoonish cgi  i wont put anthony waller in the same bracket as stephen sommers as a director who totally ruins a movie because of an over reliance on cgi  the major problem with aawip is the screenplay coupled with a high degree of expectation from those who saw the  movie classic  but i would have preferred the rick baker type special effects used for the transformation  to be fair its reasonable to speculate that perhaps the budget didnt stretch that far  but at the end of the day this is a fairly poor horror movie that didnt need to be made and dog soldiers is much better entertainment
