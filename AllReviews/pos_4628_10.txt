POS it was riveting i just could not look away as the movie rolled on i started to feel that it was powerful and confronting but i had no idea how much more intense it would get br br the movie gives an insight into what unfortunately is everyday life for a lot of school kids some of us live outside that environment and would walk by and not know what is happeningbr br parents need to see this film in particular just to see a glimpse of what their kids go through often parent dismiss their kids problems as trivial but unfortunately to a high schooler they are massive and unfortunately the problems can escalate into a tragedybr br definitively a must see for all
