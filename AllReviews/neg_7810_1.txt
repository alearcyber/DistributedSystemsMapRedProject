NEG i was intrigued by the nasty boss character as i am one myself and the actual bosss daughter was attractive and it was interesting to see an even younger ashton kushner but this movie is so puerile i had to turn it off it was a waste of time to watch it when people started peeing all over the living room it was too much to watch painful awful crap movie if they had just toned it down a little are there really people out there that find it funny and like it i was relieved to know that imdb readers rated it so low the career side to the story was intriguing as well as the young man trying to get a promotion and win the bosses favor i liked that part also the opening scene with the coworkers on the train was cool as i like his coworkers characters if you can stomach nonsense movies or you are pretty young then it might be one you can stomach
