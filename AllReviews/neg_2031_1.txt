NEG somewhere in usa the young clair manipulates her friends mic billy and john showing a letter that would be sent by bob to her and the group cowardly beats bob and mic kills him with a piece of wood in the forest mic feels sorrow and decides to tell his mother what he did but john and billy threaten him with tragic consequencesbr br i believe the wind is the worst movie i have ever seen in my life the awful screenplay is ridiculous and it is almost impossible to write a summary since there is no story or plot only sequences of disconnected scenes the amateurish direction and acting are amazingly poor and terrible it is unbelievable how producers invest money in such garbage distributors release this crap worldwide and viewers like me buy this dvd i waited until the very last scene because i was curious to see how bad this film could be and i was impressed since it is worse than i could imagine in my lowest expectations in the end i question why imdb does not offer zero in the vote system since the garbage really deserves this vote my vote is onebr br title brazil fora invisvel invisible force
