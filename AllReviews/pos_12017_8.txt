POS this movie is a coveted member of my movie library while not a mainstream film it is in my view a highly effective film noir in which eric roberts is totally underrated as an actor i would qualify him as a much better actor than his sister julia who is overrated but thats another review roberts plays the downonhisluck exreporter with the perfect mix of narrative precision and jaded idealism two ingredients that are part and parcel of any effective film noir the firstperson narration by roberts enhances the quality of the movie and keeps us guessing on the real motive behind the crimebr br set in palm springs everything about the setting in the movie progresses slowly as a metaphor for the theme of oppression asch roberts is oppressed by his past the police are oppressed by the rich residents of palm springs who treat them as servants the rich meanwhile are oppressed by boredom watch johnny depps classic performance as the insightful rich kid who only wants to be loved the isolation of each character is omnipresent and is further augmented by the heat and isolation of the desertbr br there is an audience for this film if theyre looking for a more contemporary version of film noir while there are elements of the film that might have been tighter i recommend getting a copy of this film and putting it right between the big sleep and chinatown in your movie library the film is based on the arthur lyons book castles burning and if you like robertss acting in this one you may want to get a copy of the ambulance in which he showcases his funnier lighter side best line in the film careful careful of what i shouldve asked only fools ignore the strange warnings of trailer park ladies
