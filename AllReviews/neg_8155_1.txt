NEG this movie was in a box set with  others with varying quality  i can safely say that this title was right at the bottom of the heapbr br it is pointless to go through the plot what there was of it picking out what was wrong as i havent got all day  life is to short which reminds me i have just lost around  minutes of mine watching this tripebr br the acting was diabolically bad in a way that made it funny though only just whilst the comedy elements like the two idiotic cops must have made any laurel  hardy fans groan one of the only barely funny moments was when the leading lady made a joke about her former friends plastic tts which would have been okay if i hadnt had to watch them bob around whenever she waddled on the screenbr br the lowest i can give is one  it probably deserves that for having heather thomas in it as she was certainly sexy  shapely though her acting was as bad as everyone else
