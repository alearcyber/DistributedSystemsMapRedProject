NEG the comebacks is a spoof on inspirational sports movies and let me just tell youit is not a good one tom brady the director probably found it hilarious that referencing sports films from gridiron gang invincible and even miracle to the longest yard and dodgeballyes dodgeball and tossing in a couple of sex jokes would be the funniest thing since airplane well he was wrong they did such a slipshod job youd thought it was written in a week i have found it that if a director loves the genre the movie will be good obviously brady does not love the genre he is spoofing this movie is a rancid piece of garbage not worth viewing so dont see it
