POS music videos are often completely disregarded in any discussion about film with most people considering them to be a lesser art form while a great majority are merely flashy clips to advertise a popular performers latest hit single a precious few really do rise above the rest becoming works of art in their own right anything directed by spike jonze or michel gondry is always worth watching while art isnt precisely the word id use to describe michael jacksons thriller  it is an intenselylikable hybrid of schlock horror and music and an outrageouslycampy short film that remains remarkably endearing nearly  years later the thirteenminute music video both the longest and most expensive ever at the time of its release was directed by john landis a filmmaker im not terribly familiar with though the blues brothers  is a classic and i hear that an american werewolf in london  is a stupendously entertaining horrorcomedybr br whether or not thriller actually qualifies as a music video is certainly up for debate taking into account its extensive length though jackson bettered this effort with s ghosts at  minutes and the fact that the title song comprises less than half of the total running time the video opens with a brief filmwithinafilm as michael on a quiet and brightlylit night reveals to his girlfriend ola ray that he is different from other guys transforming into a hideous werewolf as the nighttime clouds part to reveal a full moon as he presumably decapitates the unfortunate heroine we come across michael and his girl in the movie theatre actually watching this drama unfold in a horror picture when the girl becomes frightened they both leave cinema and begin to walk home at which point michael begins to sing the opening lines of his latest song thriller however when a hoard of bloodthirsty zombies emerge from the local graveyard their entrance ghoulishly narrated by vincent price the situation begins to get interestingbr br its difficult to quite put my finger on why thriller is considered one of the greatest of all music videos it cant simply be that the song itself is a lot of fun and michael jackson  though he has since become the butt of all comedians jokes for his peculiar personality and doings  theres no doubt that he is an excellent singer and performer perhaps a decent explanation for the films popularity is the incredible amount of work that must have gone into it nothing like it had ever been seen before and it still remains something of an oddity in the world of music videos the gruesome monster makeup effects were engineered by rick baker and are surprisingly graphic for a music clip though its all carried out with a good sense of fun several moments make for some genuinely exciting suspense successfully capturing the atmosphere of the films which it is parodying though always with a cheesy twist on the usual formula simply put youll never look at a zombie movie in the same way again
