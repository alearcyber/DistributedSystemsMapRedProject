NEG jess franco makes exploitation films and he has made tons of them franco is responsible for some of the most shocking films in cinema history and god bless him for it unfortunately the diamonds of kilominjaro is a truly awful movie that is not up to his usual standardsbr br exploitation films should be judged on story sex and gore what else is there this film fails on most of those benchmarks the plot is paper thin placing a nubile young girl in the jungle among cannibals we really dont get information on why she and her father were there in the first place as expected her father is the big white chief and she becomes a goddess sitting in trees naked add fortune hunters and precious stones and you have your basic rescue the girl for greedy intentions plot line the characters are stock not adding an ounce of believability to the proceedingsbr br gore none or at least very little this film is often mentioned in the same vein as the classic italian cannibal movies those seeking that type of gore need to run the other way save for one cheap beheading this movie features surprisingly little blood and gutsbr br as best i can tell the only reason this movie exists is so katja bienert aliene mess and mari carmen neieto could run around naked actually lita mari carmen neieto does the full frontal heavy lifting while the two jungle ladies are bare chested throughout yes there are love scenesprobably the most sterile franco has ever supervised the women are beautiful but nothing here to really make this movie an erotic classic eitherbr br this movie just reeks of low budget buffoonery the sets are laughable the acting is horrid and the editing is confusing there is no real story to hold this together and not enough of a budget or effort to shock or titillate i think franco fans have come to expect more out of the master of exploitation
