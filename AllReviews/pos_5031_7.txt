POS though this film doesnt stand out particularly from the movie crowd its still a very nice film to sit down and watch with your feet up there maybe the odd one or two mistakes you catch and the cinematic are a little slipshod the film itself is very enjoyable and has a wonderful atmosphere to it the music contributes a lot to the mood of the moviebr br the acting is none the less impressive especially the dog he he with john travolta taking the lead of the funtroublesomeloving michael other characters feel very genuine and perform very well within the filmbr br so after a long day at work stick michael on in the evening with some icecream and enjoy a very quality film in its own right
