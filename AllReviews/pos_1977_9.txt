POS br br my favorite science fiction incredible ride through mistrust and the warping of reality probably the best performance i have ever seen jude law play incredibly original with interesting character developments and a story line that twists and turns so rapidly that it takes a couple of minutes after the film to fully grasps its genius even more fun watching it again for the end changes the beginning
