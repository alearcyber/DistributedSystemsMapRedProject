NEG good grief to think ive seen it all danny thomas looks so out of place in this mishmash he seems really uncomfortable he cant sing worth a lick and when hes paired up with peggy lee peggy lee she easily easily outsings him maybe the director saw this and made him do the reall really bad comedy routines that he sometimes does in the film peggy lee is okay but the whole thing is a shambles good for a laugh maybe
