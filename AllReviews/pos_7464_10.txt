POS my friends and i rented this movie simply to satisfy a friend who was very bent on renting it despite having no idea what it was about we all thought it would be like a canadian american pie but when we watched it we were completely surprised we were all silent throughout the movie and loved it it was nothing like american pie and had a plot that teenage girls are sure to adore seeing as the guy gets the crap beaten out of him at the end after that night it became my favorite movie for not only its plot but the actors and the great writing there wasnt a moment where i thought that it was unbelievable everything is very realistic and relateable for anybody living in a small town with little prospects i absolutely adore this movie and would recommend you to rent it next time you have a chance its worth it
