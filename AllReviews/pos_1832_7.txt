POS i will start by saying i have always been a bonnie hunt fan she always adds life to any character she plays and she did a wonderful job in her directorial debutbr br i have to admit this is a chick flick but keeping that in mind it is a wonderful story it touches on many emotions and elicits all sorts of reactionsbr br this film depicts real life like people with real life like situations tho i have to exclude the coincidence that is the major part of the filmbr br its a love story not just of a man and a woman but the love of family friends and loved ones past even petsbr br i really enjoyed it well worth the rental or the purchase
