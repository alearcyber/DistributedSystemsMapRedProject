NEG i made a big mistake going to see this film thats the lottery of going to see films i guess after five minutes you just knew it was going to be a clunker and i fought quite hard to stay in my seat  the old lose two hours of your life kind of feelingbr br the fundamental problem is that without even mentioning the whole historical accuracy thread of reviews the script is achingly painful badbr br the first thirty minutes could have been spread out to an hour to give a plausible real plot development instead it lurched from from one undramatic dramatic event to the next having the girl cry at the start of the film makes no sense because the audience has no emotional attachment to anything at this point and that whole walking off into the sunset through the longgrass field at the end what the hell was that about br br not even the excellent ed harris could save this one you could almost feel his pain at some of the lines he had to utter the most fabulously awful one was for no apparent reason he stares at the girl as she copies his work in his apartment she looks up it all goes a bit fuzzy romantic kinda lighting or am i dreaming and he says with authority in his voice br br wash me br br and she gets up and washes him with a sponge wash me wtf thats hilariousbr br and then there was the music the long extended session when it was just beethoven conducting and the th symphony pouring out of the surround sound in the cinema and the choir waiting waiting standing there silently for what seems like forever and then finally launching into enormous sound it was spinechillingly wonderful and dare i say it it brought tears to my eyesbr br so that is where the film picked up two stars the only part of the film where beethoven got to say exactly what he wanted to saybr br and i believed him
