POS the cure is an outstanding reallife drama that deals with a very sensitive subject it is the story of the profound and dear friendship between two boys eric and dexter the latter has acquired aids from a blood transfusion thus he and his mom annabella sciorra have become outcasts shunned by the public and labeled as dangerous company basically due to a common lack of public knowledge of the diseasebr br when eric brad renfro known from the client and apt pupil and his mom move into the house next to them he has to deal with public insults and the fear of catching aids himself however eric overcomes his fear and risks everything at first he starts talking to dexter but eventually he climbs over the fence and joins the witty boy played by jurassic parks joseph mazzello and his games very quickly he develops a real friendship with dexter who is delicately built and frail due to his conditionbr br the central theme of the movie  the theme which makes it pervasively authentic and tragic at the same time  is how eric and dexter try to find the ultimate cure at first they experiment with all kinds of plants and leaves  which is very naive but also genuine at the same time as it shows how young kids deal with such heinous diseases and how strongly they still believe in the magic of the world when they hear about an alleged cure which has been developed in the south they do not hesitate and take off for an adventure that will bring them even closer together and symbolizes the ultimate quest for hopebr br so they board a raft and head southwards on the mississippi river what starts as a real adventure becomes a dangerous undertaking which is emotionally intriguing and instructive at the same time the scene when dexter reveals his fears and talks about the end of the universe where everything is dark and cold eric hands him his sneaker a symbol that wherever the boy may have to go eric is and will always be with him he will never have to be alone this sequence which is one of the most compelling ones of the movie features a very convincing interaction between the two actors who manage to avoid awkward and corny dialogs and deliver a very genuine performance that is eventually smashing in its tenderness and honestybr br i will not go any further in outlining the plot as i do not intend to give away too much information the ending however is emotionally tough and makes the audience so much a part of the tragedy that everyone who watches the movie will feel personally affected this aspect makes this movie so strong so outstanding and so convincing the emotional burden on every character is so real and so thrashing that even the tougher members of the audience might need some hankiesbr br a  is doing justice to this movie and is not too high a rating there is hardly any other movie i have seen in my life so far that handles such an emotional issue with so much wit and sensibility it is the story of how two boys make each others life richer and how they teach each other lessons of life thus dexter overcomes his isolation and sadness and eric learns what really counts in life and both of them realize how much of a gift real friendship is when it comes to the hardest moments of lifebr br this movie is tragic  but its message is sheer inspiration
