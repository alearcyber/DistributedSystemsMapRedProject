NEG can anyone give me a reason why only one american dies in this movie and when he does it is supposed to be a very emotional scene yet when the operation delta force team kills hundreds of russians in slowmotion action scenes or thousands of arabs also in slowmotion action scenes you are supposed to cheer and say take that you nonamerican monsters i know i used slowmotion action scenes a lot but that is because every action scene in this movie is in you guessed it slowmotion every last one of them and this squad should be called invincible slowmotion bulletdodging force since they seem to have supernatural powers that help them to dodge bullets and if this supernatural power fails they have some kind of regeneration superpower which is all they need to kill the complete nonamerican army that stands between them and victory by this point nobody cares since they have been put to sleep by another laughable slowmotion action scene that is if they are not laughing out loud at the bad acting cheesy dialogues and incredibly poor story which is what i did the cast is made of unknown actors which will probably remain unknown since they dont even play characters they are just playing guys with gunsand lets not forget superpowers the only quality is that the special effects are surprisingly not that badalthough they are in slowmotion for a tv movie but it still sucks and at the same time is so bad its good ok maybe at the end it gets a little too repetitivebr br
