NEG i think i would probably not hate this movie if i spoke polish i selected the english version at the first menu but it gave me polish dialogue with english subtitles just as the polish version did maybe the dialogue was so disjointed because the person that did the subtitles could not translate it into english very well to exacerbate the issue some of the dialogue had no subtitles at all the acting was pretty bad especially the female lead who was melodramatic about everything one scene that bothered me was when a german woman was caught stealing and as the mob was jostling her around her shirt opened and the director showed closeups of her naked breast for the next  seconds i couldnt see how her breast added to the drama of the scene or the film maybe the director was trying to increase the numbers of teenage boys in the audience much of the film takes place in an extermination camp liberated by the americans first the american uniforms did not look anything like us army uniforms second none of the extermination camps in poland were liberated by the americans i would think that a polish film director who turned  in  would know better than an american born in  that all six extermination camps were liberated by the russians all in all its just not a very good film if you dont speak polish
