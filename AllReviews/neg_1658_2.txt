NEG aimless teens on summer break in a small ohio town cant find any meaningful ways to fill their time some consider driving to chicago others are content to drink and bully their peers in a random act of alcoholfueled arrogance the bullies rough up a homeless man and steal a strange book the handwritten text turns out to contain archaic spells designed to summon demonic forces a night or two later one of them reads an incantation and is quickly possessed he turns into a vicious killer and begins to quietly prey on his former peersbr br demon summer is an amateur production with a microscopic budget the production values are low but the filmmakers were smart enough to not be ambitious little in the way of special props or shooting locations were needed the acting is especially weak and there is virtually nothing original in the screenplay on the positive side the special makeup effects are surprisingly good by low budget film standards despite this the gore is minimal makeup effects aside there is little going for this film even for diehard gorehounds not recommended
