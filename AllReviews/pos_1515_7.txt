POS well this is newfamous italian horror director lucio fulci shoots a film about a famous italian horror director calledlucio fulci after years and years of witnessing gruesome horror sequences it becomes hard for lucio to separate reality from fiction and he often hallucinates about committing violent murders he quickly descends further into a seemly endless spiral of madness and unverifiable venom even the dedicated psychiatrist cant seem to keep fulci on the right track now when it comes to pure fun and entertainment value cat in the brain certainly is one of fulcis most pleasant films the gore is overpowering and copious to say the least the amount of filthy massacres is impossible to describe especially when you manage to get your hands on the fully uncut version referred to with the akanightmare concert decapitations all around victims  intestines are spread on all sides of the screen and the chainsaws are working overtime the film also becomes unintentionally funny quite soon since its so exaggerated and a perfect experience to watch with a group of friends when theres beer in the fridge of course from a more professional viewpoint this production cant exactly be called a masterpiece theres not the least bit of tension or atmosphere to detect and the characters are completely emptyheaded in order to make more room for the gore characters are just being introduced for  seconds and subsequently die a horrible death especially compared with fulcis highlights  like the beyond or dont torture a duckling  this film looks like a quickly warmed up snack the best way to interpret cat in the brain is like a personal statement made by fulci and a direct attack towards censorship perhaps after seeing so many of his films  especially the latter ones  being cut by censorship committees and bashed by pseudoartistic critics he wanted to avenge himself by delivering a gory mess that simply cant be cut if you take out all the explicit violence and the truly sick makeup effects you only got about  minutes of footage left especially because the insane killings reoccur later in the film as fulci hallucinates about them again you can almost hear our director think stuff like lets see how youre going to censor this now even the entire development of the murder investigation happens in the background are the victims missed by any of their friends or relatives are there any police officers looking for clues thatll lead them to the killer you dont know and lucio doesnt bother to inform you about that because that would lead to sequences that dont require cutting oh and its pretty damn pretentious as well the name mr fulci or even lucio is mentioned every  minutes  times throughout the entire movie to be exact and our director clearly enjoys being in the spotlights for a change hey i certainly dont blame himafter over  years of delivering amusing movies he deserved to have a little extra fun youre a god mr fulci
