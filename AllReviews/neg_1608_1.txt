NEG it is so bad i can not tear myself away i keep asking myself why why with every scenebr br there is no continuity but then again if you want to make a very overtly homosexual movie with a fetishistic attitude towards all things big big boats big boys big planes then you dont have to worry about things like plot or character i am baffled and very concerned that the cag looks so much like richard pryor it seems wrong to put a pryor look alike in such a terrible movie but i cant tear myself away this movie is the first movie ive ever reviewed that is how phenomenally bad and bizarre it is it motivated me to join this site i have counted  main characters perhaps if i was stoned i could follow this but as it is i feel like im in some kind of never ending bad dream where it is always  and we were the greatest cocktry on earth
