POS i have to admit i have a particular penchant for the humor and story telling style of british movies though not all of course succeedbr br this film made me think and left me in the end with a quiet smile on my face its about character development and relationships truth and lies and whether love is sometimes simply not enough some very nicely understated acting from all the participants especially the two leads tom wilkinson and emily watsonbr br there was a lot of fuss made about gosford park but with this piece i feel fellowes has actually produced a better movie though it has not been a mainstream releasebr br an intelligent mature story about real people who are undeniably flawed but also capable of acts of genuine graciousness
