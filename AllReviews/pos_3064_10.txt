POS mel brooks really outdid himself with this hilarious standup of the robin hood story the cast is perfect and cary elwes does a fine job at his role in my personal opinion besides the fact that im a cary elwes fan this movie is the best and funniest ive ever seen it will have you laughing every time you see it
