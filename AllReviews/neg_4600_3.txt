NEG doesnt mean this movie is good i was really frustrated by it on many levels its kind of the tip of the hat to bukowski hey ive read that guy in collegelets see what matt dillon does with him and i like matt dillon i thought he came close to looking a little like hank but mostly just the ruddy cheeks i have to care about a character though and there just wasnt much here to care about i think time might be cruel to bukowski and that bothers me a lot because the writing was solid in a sort of post counter culture time hard to sit through scenes that went nowhere and a soundtrack that made me want to vomit i ask for very little got less
