NEG i am not surprised to find user comments for this film full of gushy nonsense such as that this film proves that when it is predestined love will find a way i begin in this way not to criticize a specific reviewer but because this citation so typifies the hyperbolic uncritical treacle that was poured out over this film even before it hit the theaters even the best of films do not prove anything nor are they intended to the best films entertain and move the viewer and the english patient fails on both criteriabr br i remember the studios promotion of the english patient very clearly from the producers of amadeus and one flew over the cuckoos nest it grandly announced an ignorant or careless listener might miss the crucial word producers in this disingenuous statement and mistakenly associate the director of the english patient so very inappropriately with the truly great director milos forman such a comparison is offensive to the memory of mr formanbr br while the novel by michael ondaatje upon which the film was based is a good one it is unfortunate that the film failed to capture any quality of the book in any way whatsoever aside from plot elements that seem only coincidentally similar the film bears little resemblance to the novelbr br despite misgivings which began when i heard that shamelessly misleading promotion i went to see this film in the theater as it began to unfold i realized that the rendering of the novels peculiar magic had failed that the actors knew their words but not their characters and that their characters were flat dull and unengaging the film was a complete travesty of ondaatjes novel and a completely stillborn cinematic artifact of the worst descriptionbr br those who gush over this film are very apt to speak with adjectives like sweeping and grand and hypnotic well it is none of those in fact not even ondaatjes fine novel could be described as sweeping or grand it could be described as magical and hypnotic  yet these are precisely the qualities that the film so utterly failed to deliver it is almost as if minghella had as a reader entirely missed what was valuable in the novel and could grind out on celluloid only a pale skeletal version a version that not only missed the spirit of the story but that focused on the wrong characters he produced a filmic transliteration that not only had no respect for storys metaphors but no apparent cognizance of them as wellbr br minghella took the central focus away from hana and kip and put it on the patient and katherine clifton thereby missing the narrative trail of the novel as well as the essence of itbr br ralph fiennes and kristen scott thomas put in unengaging uninspiring uninvolving unemotional performances that were obviously intended to convey a great driving passionate loveaffair to the viewer but which in fact delivered only an inexplicable perfunctory liaison between two flat shallow uninteresting adulterers both actors are physically and emotionally inadequate and unexciting and neither performance provided the viewer with the great emotional response obviously intended by minghellas grandiose and overblown presentationbr br the grand sweeping davidleanlike qualities to which the many undiscriminating reviewers of this goofy film love to refer simply is not there the comparison to david lean dr zhivago is positively insulting to yet another great director take for example the patients sandstorm scene which is no doubt one wherein these grand sweeping qualities are believed to have resided or should have resided the sandstorm is not grand  it is not even convincing the subsequent burying of the characters in the automobile and their emergence after the storm which no doubt was supposed to affect the viewer dramatically and emotionally completely lacked either drama or emotion in fact because it was so patently weak it had an air of comedy about it where comedy was clearly out of placebr br this film failed it failed as a rendering of the novel and it failed as a film it seems to have been the anointed oscar vehicle of the year joining such overtrumpeted filmic slosh as kramer vs kramer or terms of endearment one can only thank god that even the hypedriven acadamybr br had the good sense to present the best actress award to frances mcdormand for her truly deserving performance in the truly excellent film fargo there was not a single performance in the execrable english patient that was not either embarrassingly horrid overacting willem dafoe or truly forgettable mediocre acting fiennes and scott thomasbr br why this nonentity of a film retains a coven of fanatical and clearly tasteless devotees will remain a mystery fortunately the sands of time will bury this mediocrity of a film permanently and it will not thankfully have the strength ever to dig itself out
