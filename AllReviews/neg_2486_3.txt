NEG  some spoilers br br this movie is sometimes subtitled life everlasting thats often taken as reference to the final scene but more accurately describes how dead and buried this onceestimable series is after this sloppy and illogical sendoffbr br theres a hey kids lets put on a show air about this telemovie which can be endearing in spots some fans will feel like insiders as they enjoy picking out all the various cameo appearances cowriter coproducer tom fontana and his pals pack the goingson with friends and favorites from other shows as well as real baltimore personagesbr br thats on top of the returns of virtually all the members of the televisions show varied casts your old favorites as well as later nonfavoritesbr br there was always a tugofwar pitting qualityconscious executive producer barry levinson fontana james yoshimura and the rest of the creative team against budgetconscious nbc execs who simply wanted a another moronic police procedural like nash bridges which regularly beat homicide in the ratings the pressure told as the show bounced between riveting realism that transcended its form and sleazy sensationalism that demeaned itbr br unfortunately for this movie fontana cowriters yoshimura and eric overmeyer and director jean de segonzac simply threw in the towel they took the most ludicrous story are from the series topped it with an unlikely and artistically unfruitful new plot line and laid the burden of carrying the whole mess on one of the weaker cast membersbr br briefly some time has passed since the last episode of the show the former heart of baltimores homicide unit yaphet kotto as lt al giardello is now a kurt schmokelike candidate for mayor and schmoke himself makes a cameo appearance but this promising start immediately and improbably takes a tragic turnbr br the spotlight shifts to giancarlo esposito as giardellos son mike a handsome man who has done good work elsewhere esposito was one of the pretty faces brought in late to supposedly enliven the tv series but the question for viewers always was is mike that uncomfortable as gees son or is esposito that uncomfortable in the rolebr br to be fair esposito doesnt get a chance to play out the main story without interruption thats because the writers choose this moment to revive another storyline that spat on the intelligence of the shows loyal votersbr br an apparent snuff streaming video was promoted and then seemed to actually take place on the internet after some red herrings the detectives arrested a repellent suspect but zaljko ivaneks harassed and overworked deputy states attorney forgot to file motions in time and the suspect was released only to be murdered laterbr br lets summarize he forgot to file the paperwork because it wasnt the most sensational case of his career because the mayor the attorney general the governor the entire maryland legislature the us attorney general nbc court tv the bbc ap reuters people the sun the washington post the new york times the la times time magazine the times of london the economist the johannesburg mail and guardian losservatore romano le figaro paris match lequipe and computer world werent calling every  minutes to ask about the status of the casebr br nevertheless the old gang of detectives and associates flocks back to baltimore to help out theres quite an array of talent on display unfortunately with the limited amount of dialogue to hand out some of them are merely on displaybr br two of the strongest actors clark johnson and melissa leo are criminally underused while time wasted on jon seda and michael michelle could be better spent on commercials the writers do seem to satirize this presenting jason priestley as the latest bigdeal detective on the other hand they give easycome easygo michelle forbes a very affecting scenebr br theres some other sly casting with actual lt gary daddario the center of the book that gave rise to the show playing another detective guests drop in from other shows like whitney allen doing her deadpan and clueless miss sally from the childrens show beloved by the inmates on fontanas oz dina napoli of wbal tv turns up as herself br br even when entertaining though these guests can be distracting ed begley jr actually advances the story in his brief appearance playing dr victor ehrlich from fontanas st elsewhere hes still a vivid character and fits in a hospital setting then you remember didnt st elegius turn out to be an autistic boys fantasybr br the most useful cameo reflects corporate synergy this movie was made when court tv bought rerun rights to the series that network contributed legal waif helen lucaitis who had interviewed the homicide team and later appeared on oz the tv correspondent does an efficient job summarizing the news that is plot points for latecomersbr br although shes so thin that she disappears when she turns sideways lucaitis also adeptly handles a bit of physical comedy with esposito he shows more juice in his scenes with lucaitis than with any of his usual colleagues perhaps those two should have done a spinoffbr br as the movie winds down the cream of the cast rises to the top although they are saddled with a loser script andre braugher and kyle secor overcome it their performances remind viewers what made homicide for considerable stretches the best show on the air and one of the best television productions everbr br its fun to watch top pros do their stuff its just a shame this movie doesnt give them more of a chance diehard fans may want to see this movie anyway but you can live without it
