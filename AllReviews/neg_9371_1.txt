NEG tru calling was good but it could have been great the concept was intriguing and allowed for seriously strange and frightening story lines that might have been explored in future unfortunately the writing and an actor let the show downbr br the writing wasnt too bad but there were holes in episode  drop dead gorgeous an incredibly toxic poison was supposedly used to kill the victim this was so toxic and killed so quickly the victim had no time to run or even scream for help yet there was no plausible explanation for how the killer obtained such a powerful poisonbr br in episode  the getaway the offduty policeman responded unrealistically in the second diner scene he meekly tells the robber to drop the gun and when she doesnt follow the order and in fact turns the gun in his direction he allows it to turn into a standoff and then escalate into a hostage situation  the very situation hed been warned about his response should would have been to shoot the robber when she failed to follow his order and upon her turning the gun on him there are other faults in the stories but ill leave it with these two examples in spite of the writing faults i did like the showbr br the other problem i had was that i just could not accept eliza dushku in this roll in my opinion she is too inexperienced and lightweight to carry this part she never walked anywhere she marched and far too often she came to an abrupt stop on her mark br br she also lacked any really emotional facial expression or intonation she either has a pensive look or a cute smile rarely are other emotions apparent when she tries to appear dramatic she begins her line looking away and then turns her eyes to her fellow actor or alternatively she begins her line looking at her opposite and then looks away both are annoying when done as a replacement for true emotion an example of her lack of intonation is in episode  two weddings and a funeral during her second wedding speech is devoid of emotion eg hearts in our heartsbr br i liked all of the other actors in their respective parts and they were all believable with improved writing and a lead change tru calling might have made it
