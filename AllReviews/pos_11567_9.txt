POS being a s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoonsbr br i dont know why early s cartoons had something special i dont know if it was the uncertainty atmosphere a generational change whatever but tiny toons kept the s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever createdbr br the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagersbr br the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead
