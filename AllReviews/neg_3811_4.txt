NEG i first heard of this movie at the flashback weekend in chicago  for the nightmare on elm street robert englund was really talking the movie up and he was great in his part of hatchet the same can be said for tony todd knowing this is a low budget first time director  writer it delivers every bit as much as the big budget and also cameo laden holloween  remakereimaginingbr br technically it falls short in a couple of places the alligator attack seen was shoot too dark when it happened the dark head of the alligator against the swamp clamping on to the black pants became almost invisible the mood music in the swamp scenes was too loud in volume and canned like a bad sitcom and just like holloween  someone is smart enough to have a gun but of course shooting the killer is only a pause button for the killer the ending well as soon as i saw where it was going i knew what was going to happen not very originalbr br the highlights of the movie are the characters and their interactions unlike holloween  we got to meet the people and care what happened to them ben joel moore who is also the lead of spiralthe sulking lead and marcus not another teen movieas the best friend and funny man to root for during the movie shapiro joel murry dharma  greg jenna joleigh fioreavanti and misty mercedes mcnab of buffy the vampire slayer the series angel the series and the addams family movies give a convoluted reason for topless women mr and mrs permatteo played by television regulars richard riehle grounded for life patrika darbo step by stepas the older couple that you know dont stand a chance even the tour guide shawn parry shen is a fleshed out character i hope to see more from all involved in this film but i think it will play better on home video than in the theater sorry
