NEG the mill on the floss was one of the lesser novels by mary ann evans who wrote under the male pseudonym george eliot i tried to read this dull and very turgid novel years ago but was unable to finish it ill review this film version solely on its own merits as i dont know how faithfully it follows the original novelbr br the films opening credits are printed in an old english typeface that suggests the mediaeval period and so its a very poor choice for a film with a thcentury setting on the other hand about halfway into the film we see a closeup shot of a handbill advertising an estate auction this handbill is set in authentic victorian type fonts and looks very convincing most of this film is extremely convincing in its depiction of the architecture and clothing of early thcentury england the precise location of this films story is never disclosed but  judging by the actors accents  id place it as somewhere in the cotswolds perhaps warwickshirebr br the plot what there is of it involves a mill that changes hands a couple of times over a couple of decades between two rival families one wealthy and one workingclass i disagree with another imdb reviewer who claims that james mason has only a small role in this film mason has the largest and most central role in this drama as the scion of the wealthier family as the spoilt and petulant tom tulliver mason is darkly brooding and impetuous his performance here belongs in a better film it made me want to see wuthering heights recast with mason as heathcliffbr br as this is a multigenerational saga something which george eliot did much better in middlemarch several of the main roles in this film are split among two actors apiece child actors in the prologue adults in the main narrative the prologue of this film features a very wellwritten scene establishing tom tulliver as wilful and bullyragging from an early age and young philip wakeham as decent and thoughtful through hard labour philip has earned a halfpenny tom tries to bully it away from him but is unwilling to take the coin by brute force he wants philip to give it to him all the child actors in this movie male and female are talented and attractive unfortunately all of the children speak their dialogue in posh plummyvoiced accents that are utterly unlike the accents of the actors and actresses who play those same roles as adults this discrepancy calls attention to the staginess of the material regrettably none of the later scenes are as good as this prologuebr br the climax features a crowd of labourers in a rainstorm much better paced and photographed than the earlier scenes but modern viewers in britain at least can no longer take this sort of material seriously by now practically every british comedian has done a trouble at t mill squire comedy routine parodying precisely this subject matter so i had difficulty watching this movie with a straight facebr br the character actress martita hunt is good in a small role but the opening credits in that old english typeface misspell her forename as marita ill rate this dull movie  points out of  one point apiece for james masons performance the early scene with the children and the authentic victorian typesetting in that auctioneers handbill
