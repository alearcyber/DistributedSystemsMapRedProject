NEG well i generally like iranian movies and after having seen  by kiarostami the night before i was expecting a great movie i was very disappointed this is by far the worst iranian film and one of the most boring asian movies i have ever seen if you have never seen a kiarostami movie before watch ten instead if you want some good iranian movies you may also try sib aka the apple this movie is divided in  parts and only the fourth featuring some funny ducks is worth watching if this is the first iranian movie you see you probably wont want to see any more i dont blame you but you will miss some great movies
