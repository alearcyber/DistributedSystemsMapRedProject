NEG take a bad script some lousy acting and throw in a politically incorrect morality tale and what do you get something that is supposed to pass for quality family viewingbr br seven alone is the story of a family in the th century who travel across america in a wagon train hoping for a new life in oregon there are seven children three boys three girls and a baby whose sex im not quite sure of hence the title of the filmbr br the story opens up with the family living a seemingly normal th century life on a farm in the middle of nowhere eldest son john is a precocious teenager lazy and good for nothing as his father constantly reminds him we see right off the bat that he has a penchant for practical jokes when he ties string to the hair of his sleeping sisters and connects it to a nearby mule when the mule is moved of course the poor girls are jolted out of bed john is caught by his father and is immediately punished with a strapbr br that same day a wagon train passes through pa is tempted to join up as it promises a new life in the wild wild west so the family hitches up their belongings and head offbr br from the very beginning the film seems weak and amateurish the acting is below grade as if from one of those films shown in school about the pioneers i cant blame the actors however because the lines in this film are silly and just too sickeningly sweet and optimisticbr br i must tell you that i caught this film while flipping channels one boring saturday afternoon on a christian television station not of a religious mind myself i watched in horror as seven alone offered up moral statements that were not only outdated but downright offensive if i were a good christian i would hope that i would have had the good sense to complain to the television station for airing such trash however because i am a cynical nonbeliever with a wicked sense of humor i chose to sit back and laugh myself sillybr br in one of the opening scenes the role of the father as the stern ruler of the house is established when he proposes the idea of heading off for oregon to his wife her response is a heated over my dead body we are expected to laugh i suppose as the film cuts to the next scene with pa and ma smiling as he steers the wagon along through the prairies oh i suppose even the most staunch feminist would have to admit that this fatherknowsbest attitude was the norm in those days and one could argue the need for such dictatorial rule when living conditions were difficult but i somehow got the feeling that this film supported that notion even for today lovely message coming from a christian television stationbr br anyway things get worse for the family and the films moral integrity is further diminished an indian or native american robs john as he lay sleeping in a field like a common savage the indian takes johns clothes and belongings thankfully pa with the help of passerby kit carson is able to kill the indian as well as a couple of his delinquent friends kit carson tells john that his father is a true herobr br the family is accompanied by the wagon trains resident doctor dr dutch played by aldo ray he shares pas sentiments about john stating that he is a useless brat perhaps so but he also the best thing about this film aldo rays doctor is buffoon who seems unable to tie his own shoes let alone treat one of the girls for a broken leg thankfully the young child didnt cry when the wagon ran over and snapped her leg in two because dr dutch didnt seem to have the appropriate bedside manner we know the drawbacks of constantly belittling a child heres a film that promotes that behaviorbr br later on pa develops food poisoning or something i wasnt paying much attention and he dies his death bed scene is the stuff great acting is made of frankly the man didnt even look sickbr br soon after ma dies too the children are left to fend for themselves and thats when the real adventure begins slugging it through the rapids encountering more indians these ones are nice though and venturing through snowy terrain these children do it all and i was left thinking what a bunch of garbagebr br sorry but there was nothing redeeming about this film this lowbudget little house on the prairie is a shameful waste of time and an insult to families everywhere im surprised that in  at the tail end of the feminist movement and at a time when treatment of native americans was coming into focus that something like this could actually be madebr br
