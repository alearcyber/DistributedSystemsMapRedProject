NEG all movies that contain goofy sound effects should be shot if there is one thing i hate its gotta be the use of a whoop whoop whoo when somebody gets hit one the head the only movies i have seen to do this is ghoulies iv and hobgoblins when they are in the bar and pixie is hitting the guy in the red suit with a beer bottle or rather fanning him with a beer bottle because she never really hits him with it yes ghoulies iv does suck but i have to wonder did they mean to not make the so called ghoulies mouths move when they supposedly talked their faces are almost as static as the masks used in trolls  hell i can make a better mask out of construction paper some rubber cement and a handful of glitter this sucked
