NEG honestly awful film bad editing awful lighting dire dialog and scrappy screenplaybr br the lighting at is so bad theres moments you cant even see whats going on i even tried to playing with the contrast and brightness so i could see something but that didnt helpbr br they must have found the script in a bin the character development is just as awful and while you hardly expect much from a jeanclaude van damme film this one manages to hit an all time low you cant even laugh at the cheesynessbr br the directing and editing are also terrible the whole film follows an extremely tired routine and fails at every turn as it bumbles through the plot that is so weak its just unrealbr br theres not a lot else to say other than its really bad and nothing like jeanclaude van dammes earlier work which you could enjoybr br avoid like the plaque frankly words fail me in condemning this film
