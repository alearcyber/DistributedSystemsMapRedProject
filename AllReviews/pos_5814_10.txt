POS i would recommend this for anyone who is an admirer of the late john cassavetes and for those who have never known of cassavetes it is an excellent film i really dont have the time to go into the details of why this is my opinion but if youre looking for something gutsy with lots of scenes to mull over then this one is for you the cinematography is perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of the film as well as the story itself this review does not do the film justice it is an experience one must view for themselves lots of character very genuine
