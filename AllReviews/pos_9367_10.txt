POS the real best picture of  also deals with antisemitism and is superior to elia kazans gentlemens agreement the eventual winner at that years academy awards in practically every department edmard dmytryks nearperfect direction john paxtons terse script and j roy hunts expert expressionist lighting are wonderfully abetted by a superb ensemble cast although robert young playing an easygoing methodical and very likable cop and robert mitchum who actually does have the occasional throwaway witty remark are the nominal stars of the film its oscar nominees robert ryan and gloria grahame  as well as paul kelly in the small but pivotal role of grahames pathetic husband  who give the films most memorable characterizations ryan proved so convincing as a homicidal racist that he was eventually typecast for a while excelling in equally villainous roles in such films as act of violence  caught  the racket  clash by night  the naked spur  and bad day at black rock  the film is also notable for its atypical structure in that ryans flashback sequence a complete fabrication is shot in a straightforward manner while the actual truth emerges from the hazy distorted recollections of the real protagonist of the film who furthermore isnt even played by any of the films stars also crossfire was originally to have treated homosexuality as per richard brooks original source novel the brick foxhole but this taboo subject was unacceptable to the hays office at the time  a far cry from the situation we have today when at least  gaythemed films are in the running for this years major oscarsbr br the print utilized for warners dvd transfer shows some regrettable signs of wearandtear at times but the audio commentary by noir experts james ursini and alain silver is a good one even though i dont happen to share their opinion that dmytryks career declined steadily after his huac troubles as such excellent pictures as the sniper  the caine mutiny  broken lance  the young lions  warlock  and mirage  amply prove having said that his collaborations at rko with producer adrian scott and screenwriter john paxton  murder my sweet  cornered  hopefully this will be part of the next film noir box set from warners and crossfire  do constitute his best work in any case in my opinion the latter is not only one of the key films of the s but also one of the finest noirs ever made period
