POS i always liked this movie i have seen it so many times but i always enjoyed it  the story is interesting and special but the only thing i have to disagree with is that i dont think max lived in a romanian monastery or what was that p they dont look that way in romania anyway back to the story ghita muresan played pretty well but as someone said before me his english needs to improve br br and there were some funny moments and some tragicalsad parts too it worths being seen i thought it was sweet that the giant wanted to find his love i recommended to you all its not the best movie ever but it was nice
