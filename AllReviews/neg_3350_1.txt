NEG i received a copy of this film from a friend for my st birthday which he had obviously picked up for p from a bargain video binbr br never have i been so frustrated when watching a film  it was tedious adam west was wasted literally and in retrospect i cannot recall a single thing about it my lack of enjoyment grew to such an extent that the second the credits rolled we smashed up the cassette and hung the tape around the living room just for good measure we set fire to the cover
