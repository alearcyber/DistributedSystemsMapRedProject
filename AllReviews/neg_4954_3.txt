NEG though a fan of shock and gore i found this movie disappointing to say the very least the effects and puppet work were impressive yes and the humor was welltimed but something was missing see the first act of the film is spent establishing nuances of jack brooks character despite the fact that everything we need to know about his aggression is delivered within minutes of the first title cards as for the narration and many of the flashbacks needlessbr br the pacing during the second act was tedious most of it is focused on freddy krueger eating then vomiting then eating some more then flailing his arms and saying something snappy or rude all the while the schlock is punctuated with brief scenes of jack discussing his rage problems with a therapist definitely the entertaining scenes in the film  excellent dialog worth plenty of laughs then without warning jack decides to kill a few monsters and then its overbr br all in all as a throwback to s horror movies jack brooks monster slayer has loads of potential but is purposeless and plods on without conflict or adequate resolutionbr br hopefully these issues will be addressed before jack brooks vii jack goes to hell or jack vs ash go into production
