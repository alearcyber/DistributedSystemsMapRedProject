NEG seems like some of the previous reviewers has seen another movie than what i saw earlier tonight actually this movie is the reason why i registered at imdb sure bobbie phillips can fight and for that i give this movie a  but the rest of this movie is just pure crap the acting is bad the plot is bad the camera angles are bad and the effects are bad sure the actors are in physical good shape but they cannot act sometimes i enjoy watching bad movies for the laugh but this movie had no charm and after i saw this movie i was filled with regrets for seeing it sure if you would like to see mediocre fighting without anything else then this movie is for you if not then stay away from this film ps sorry for any spelling mistakes i am just tired as a cause of this movie
