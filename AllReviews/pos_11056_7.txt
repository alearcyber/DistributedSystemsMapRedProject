POS the short film which got gaspar noe on the movie map introducing us to his horrific but thoroughly interesting character the butcher played brilliantly by phillipe nahon noes direction here has all the hallmarks of his later films showing he was carving his own voice and style from the beginning his sudden cutting along with harsh loud noise skipping flashbacks and many other techniques all are used to disconcert the viewer and it certainly works also he is not afraid of showing violence as viewers of irreversible will know here the violence is equally powerful and in the sequel seul contre tous it is almost unbearablebr br the film opens with a horse being killed it is shot in the head and we watch it writhe on the floor its pool of blood flowing out we then see a human birth in all its bloody glory the daughter of the butcher he was orphaned in wwii and has grown up hating the world and everyone and everything in it he serves his customers but his interior monologue constantly reminds us of his thoughts he wants them all dead his daughter blandine lenoir who would also reprise her role six years later is the only thing he cares about and we watch them grow older together she is however mute and the subject of bullying and toying the butchers relationship with her is almost incestuous bathing her when she is old enough to do it herself etcbut this is explored more in the next film when she is attacked by a man the butcher explodes with rage stabbing an innocent man in the mouth he goes to prison taken from the only things he wants his shop and daughter in the short  minutes we see all this and more his time in prison and release back to his world because of his daughters state autistic as well i think she is bland does little except stare and is under the full control of her father the film continues in the exceptionally bleak seul contre tous if you can watch these two films this one first it has some truly excellent acting but is very difficult to watch because of the relentless tonebr br  out of
