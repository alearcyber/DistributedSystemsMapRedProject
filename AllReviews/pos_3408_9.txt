POS i am a history teacher and overall i was pleased with the movie my teenagers enjoyed it over the holidays is it  accurate and is it a little sappy in places yesbut it took my kids away from the computer and play station to spend four nights watching it allbr br the battle scenes were impressive and we met plenty of historical characters throughout lloyd bridges as jefferson davis and hal holbrook as abraham lincoln stand out we all thought phillip casnoff as bent was evilly and charmingly brilliant we all thought charles stole the show from orry and georgebr br we will enjoy the movie again
