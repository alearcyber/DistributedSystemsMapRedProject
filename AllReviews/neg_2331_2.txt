NEG i thrive on cinemabut there is a limit a name isnt enough to make a movie the beginning of the movie puts us in a mood to expect the unseen yet but we remain hungry  or angry till the end  things are getting so confused that i admit that i did not understand the end or was there an end to this nonesense the opportunity to make an outstanding movie was there but the target was totally missed next
