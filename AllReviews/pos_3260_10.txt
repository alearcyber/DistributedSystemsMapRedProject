POS many years ago i saw this movie on television maybe and loved it so i decided to rent it on dvd the other day to see whether it still held up in my estimation it did br br set in sydneys notorious kings cross district where prostitution drug abuse and sex stores thrive it tells the story of jimmy played by heath ledger jimmy is a young manmaybe late teens or thereabouts who hasnt had a stable family background he is on the fringes of society and works as a tout for a sex club encouraging people to enter the store he is aware of an underworld figure called pando who is a local bigwig in the cross its jimmys hope that he will find himself on pandos radar and get in with hima shortcut to upward social mobility he hopesbr br one night jimmy meets the beautiful young woman alex played by the charming rose byrne you just know that a love story will play out between them on that night as well jimmy is first contacted by pando played by bryan brown pando has a job for jimmy its the foot in the door that jimmy has been waiting forbr br to reveal too much more would spoil the many surprises that this movie has in store for the viewer stylistically if you like quentin tarantino or guy ritchie movies you should be in tune with what to expecttwists and turns and black comedybr br whats so great about this movie is its very australianness its no mere knock off of tarantino or ritchie but a genuine australian contribution to the genre br br a fascinating aspect to this movie is how it all hangs together sometimes you are introduced to characters who you wonder what the hell theyre doing there in the end all these loose ends tie together beautifully its sort of like a celluloid moebius stripbr br a highlight of the movie is bryan browns character of pando pando likes puzzles and its fun to see him play games with his cronies its the little details revealed about him which are so enjoyablehis taste in music for startersbr br of the heath ledger movies i have seen the dark knight  things i hate about you this is perhaps his best role wasnt taken with  things if you are a heath ledger fan ledger recently died a tragic accidental death this is a chance to see him in his greatest australian role i think there is great chemistry between ledger and byrne in this movieso on one level it functions as nice love storybr br this movie doesnt have some of the horror of tarantino and ritchie underworld movies but it does have some adult themesscenes that surprise you with their coldness and beauty in that sense its not an ideal movie for very young viewers but its not a movie that gorehounds will get excited about either br br lastly i have to say that it is great that australia can make great movies like this usually the kind of movies my home country makes can be uniniviting this movie has strengths where many australian movies have weaknessesie it has a great story great acting and a great script we need more popular quality movies like this to be made here in australia br br highly recommended other australian movies i have loved includebr br breaker morant  mad max   my brilliant career not reviewed here by me yet proof nr the devils playground nr the year my voice broke nr bad boy bubby nr a great dark comedy the dish nr a great charming comedy
