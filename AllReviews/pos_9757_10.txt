POS i dont know where this movie was shot but because it was shot on location it has the authenticity that this story deserves it is the story of a young english woman who is taken prisoner by the japanese in southern asia at the beginning of wwii with a group of other english women there is no prison camp for women so they are forced to march for months from place to place because the japanese dont know what to do with them the courage and resilience of the english women and the bravery of the australian soldier who tries to help them is the core of the movie this movie is very long maybe  hours so you can watch it as it was shown on pbs as a series which actually adds to the feeling of the endless journey this woman makes from england across this remote island and finally australia story cinematography location and actors combine to make this a movie not to miss my only question is why this hasnt been released on dvd
