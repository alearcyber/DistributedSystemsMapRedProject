NEG i laughed twice watching this movie and in case you were wondering i wasnt having a bad day nor was i subjected to anything else that wouldve skewed my opinion while watching this cinematic bowel movement this movie is bad i wanted to enjoy it and i just couldnt with all of this talent youd think this wouldve been at least watchable right wrongbr br lets play sucked and didnt suck john travolta very likable though obviously buried under too much makeup i found him to be enjoyable to watch didnt suckbr br uma thurman after kill bill  and  the girl deserves more than this atrociously written character this characters big moment was showing someone how to operate a tmobile sidekick suckedbr br vince vaughn the done to death role of white guy who thinks hes black goes to vince money vaughn is this character template still considered to be funny i love the guy but i want to see him in something better than this it felt like he was slumming suckedbr br cedric the entertainer this guy is good he delivers a great monologue after being called a racial slur you can probably guess as to what it is that was probably the best part of the movie he was funny and truly elevated the material he was given just with his presence didnt suckbr br harvey keitel sucked due to a phoned in performancebr br james woods sucked but not his fault actually yes it was reminded me of his role in casino for some reason i dont like manic james woods i like slow burn james woods victim of bad writing maybe andre  sucked but he went down swinging i think he has potential as long as hes not being directed by a hack on his next picturebr br christina milian shes absolutely beautiful and obviously talented but this movie isnt going to make her a star didnt suck but needs a better vehicle for her talents that isnt directed by a hackbr br the rock this should have been the role that catapulted him to movie stardom but as directed by f gary gray winds up sadly mishandled in this movie the rock projects this charisma that makes him so likable that i wound up feeling sorry for him he tries really hard and while he doesnt succeed completely he gets an a for effort from me this guy is not afraid to embarrass himself and go completely against type playing a gay bodyguard with his eyes on stardom i really want to see him make it big he has what it takes as long as hes not being directed by a hackbr br which brings me to what i feel was the weak link in this production i might as well just come out and say it right f gary grays direction was about as solid as really bad diarrhea wow it was bad who had the bright idea of letting this guy direct the negotiator was good but what else on his resume convinced people that he was the man for the job between his direction and the atrocious writing im willing to chip in for both culprits to get a nice lead salad to the knees wanna see john and uma dance i might be able to think of another movie with those two that i could recommend watching instead of this not worth the ten dollars and fifty cents it cost me to get into the theaterbr br this movie couldve been okay and it wasnt even just okaybr br rating  out of br br ps fergie from black eyed peas is noteworthy to mention sizzling
