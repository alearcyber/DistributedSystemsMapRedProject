POS if you want a film with the full range of emotion look no further dramatic and funny and scenes of wrenching emotion i can safely guarantee very few will be able to view this warm and very human film without shedding a tear now and then the acting by the two leads is hard to believe you would swear the two young men really do suffer from muscular dystrophy rory and cerebral palsy michael quite simply two of the finest performances i have ever seen these are two very believable characters as well and you never have the feeling things have just been tossed in for dramatic purposes or to evoke sympathy in the dvd release as extras they have deleted scenes including an alternate ending and an extended party sequence why these clips were not included in the final film is hard to understand as they tie in with the rest of the film perfectly and are in no way superfluous but without reservation i can heartily recommend this film to anyone one of the very best i have ever seen
