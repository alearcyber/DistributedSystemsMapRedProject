POS haggard doesnt even need to be graded since it was never designed to be graded like oscarwinning movies are and it was never intended to have won an oscar obviously if you just look at some of the stuff that bam and bran tried like the fastmotion shots it comes across as a film thats something more than just cky or jackass even though those are cool too for pure enjoyability i definitely give this film a  almost every scene made me laugh until my sides hurt like falcones trail movie if you havent seen this see it and then buy it personally my favorite character is brandon falcone hes just so smooth and natural and random that its hilarious he freestyles great with the action figures and makes up the funniest stuff lol a diamond mountain bike haggard is definitely a movie that in overall humor is only rivaled by anchorman and napoleon dynamite
