NEG i have now seen quite a few films by pedro almodvar but this would have to be the most disappointing so far this film seemed to lack the zaniness that is usually everywhere in his films and the story just never got me interested many almodvar regulars appear in this film so its not like there was a lack of onscreen talent but this film just seemed more serious than his other films if there was a comedic edge to this movie i certainly couldnt find it and it made for one surprisingly weak movie
