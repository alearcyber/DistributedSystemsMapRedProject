POS im not exactly sure why i ordered fingersmith from netflix  probably because i enjoy bbc dramas it was on a list of recommendations i had no idea what i was about to see the plot which i will only describe in general so as not to spoil it for anyone who will see it after reading my review has more twists and turns than a mountain road in the rockies of the sort that customarily appear in caper movies they are very unusual in a period drama not having read the novel and i do not intend to do so i was totally unprepared for the surprise that ends the first segment on the dvd and equally surprised by the subsequent twists and turns nonetheless it is extremely well acted by the two young principals by sally hawkinsin particular as sue and by elaine cassidy as maud and in key supporting roles by imelda staunton as the mother figure in a house of thieves and by charles dance as the rich uncle who collects pornographic materials and who rescues young maud from the mad house where her mother lived to be his secretary the lesbian affair between maud and sue is the big news in the movie but really not its centerpiece the centerpiece is a plot to steal the fortune that maud is due on her st birthday the turns and twists in the plot add tension though not much credibility to the movie however no viewer is likely to doubt that maud and sue will somehow end up together  improbably  as the credits roll although one has been raised as a ady and serves a collector of pornography and the other is a pickpocket posing as a ladys maid the author obviously means for them to live together in the end its a bit difficult to swallow since each has conspired to cheat the other despite these reservations i liked movie well enough it does not quite deserve the praise that others have lavished on it the most fearsome and interesting scenes take place inside the madhouse where one of the two young women has been confined until she is able to escape and return to london to bring the story to its unexpected conclusion sally hawkins sue is a very impressive young actress able to convey her characters cascading and changing emotions with her facial expressions and her eyes no doubt well see more of her i certainly hope so
