POS in the era of the farrelly brothers and the jackass series to have a movie made and performed by americans come out that is well paced and full of charm as well as hilarity is wellnigh miraculous this ensemble has been behind some other efforts most recently a mighty wind which was so subtle it seemed to be an actual documentary without the overlay of entertainment but best in show hits on all cylinders it is superbly cast with some of the best of current us actors parker posey who exudes energy even when she stands still eugene levy as tolerant everyman who is nobodys doormat even when he appears to be or maybe indomitable doormat the brilliant stylings of fred willard the understated performances of so many others which is a characteristic not normally associated with americans or american actors one of the few humorous movies i can watch again and again
