NEG after some internet surfing i found the homefront series on dvd at ioffercom before anyone gets excited the dvd set i received was burned by an amateur from home video tapes recorded off of their tv  years ago the resolution and quality are poor the images look like you would expect old rerecorded video to look although the commercials were edited out the ending credits of each episode still have voiceover announcements for the segway into the abc news program nightline complete with the top news headlines from the early s even with the poor image quality the shows were watchable and the sound quality was finebr br to this shows credit the casting was nearly perfect everyone was believable and really looked the part their acting was also above average the role of jeff metcalf is played particularly well by kyle chandler most recently seen in the  remake of king kong the period costumes were very authentic as were the sets especially the s kitchens with vintage appliances and dcor the direction was also creative and different for a tv show at that time for example conversations between characters were sometimes intercut with conversations about the same subject between other characters in different scenes the dialog of the different conversations was kept fluid despite cutting back and fourth between the different characters and locations that takes good direction and editing and they made it work in this casebr br as i started watching this series again i suddenly remembered why i lost interest in it  years ago despite all the ingredients for a fine show the plots and story lines are disappointing and confusing right from the start for one thing the name of the show itself is totally misleading when wwii ended in  there was no more fighting so obviously there was no longer a homefront either curiously the first episode of the show homefront begins in  after the war had ended thats like shooting the first episode of gilligans island showing the castaways being rescued the whole premise of the shows namesake is completely lost i still held on to hope with the possibility of the rest of the series being a flashback but no the entire show takes place from  through  additionally this series fails miserably in any attempt to accurately portray any historical events of the late s by the third episode it becomes obvious that this series was nothing more than a thinly veiled vehicle for an ultra leftwing political agenda the show is set in river run ohio near toledo however the shows ongoing racism theme makes it look more like jackson mississippi than ohio part of the ensemble cast are dick williams hattie winston and sterling macer jr who portray the davis family much of the series shows the davis family being discriminated against by the evil whites to the point of being ridiculous and totally absurd if not laughable the racism card has been played and over played by hollywood now for over  years we get it were also tired of having our noses rubbed in it on a daily basis the subject of racism is also unpopular with viewers and it is the kiss of death for any show as it was for homefront the acting talents of williams winston and macer were wasted in their roles as the stereotypical frightened  angry black family the wildly exaggerated racism in this series makes it look like everyone in ohio was a kkk member or something the racism issue could have been addressed in this show in a single episode with a simple punch in the nose or fistfight in which a bigot gets a well deserved thrashing and leave it at that devoting a major portion of the series to the racism thing gets really old really quick and its just plain stupidbr br in yet another ridiculous plot line the big boss of a local factory ken jenkins is portrayed as an ebenezer scrooge like character who is against pensions and raises and is unconcerned about acid dripping on his employees the workers revolt and take over the factory in a blatant procommunist propaganda message to the viewerbr br personally i think this series had great potential the writers could have easily placed the timeline in    as the title suggests and shown the hardships of food and gas rationing and working  hour days at war factories of course the loss of brothers sons and husbands fighting overseas would have also added drama the situation was also perfect for writing in special guest stars as military or uso personnel passing through their town during training or enroute to europe or the pacific the possibilities for good story lines and plots are endless but no the writers of homefront david assael and james grissom completely ignored any relevant or interesting plots instead they totally missed the point and strayed into a bizarre and irrelevant obsession with racism and leftwing politics it would be unfair to the actors to condemn the entire series but the plots and situations in which they were placed are total garbage
