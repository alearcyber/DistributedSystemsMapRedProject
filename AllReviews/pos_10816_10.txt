POS bon voyage is fun for the audience because it combines the requisite silliness of a comedy with just enough sobriety to keep viewers actively engaged and invested in the outcome most importantly though the film is also historically instructive it captures the tension of the socalled phony war and later the french aristocracys flight from paris ahead of the german onslaught yet bon voyage is not a war movie it is a comedy about the lives of a handful of people set against the backdrop of extraordinary times bon voyage conveys the chaos confusion and emotional bewilderment of a nation of the brink of collapse and the wide spectrum of french reactions to the new political order this film is a comedy which entertains the audience a romance which skillfully utilizes many clichs and a story of a handful of people whose nation is collapsing around them
