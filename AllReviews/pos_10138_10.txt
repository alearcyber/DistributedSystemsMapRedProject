POS the fact that the movie is based on a true story contributes to a better and of course more realistic experience and keeps the viewer focused on the basic theme of the movie the story is filled with unexpected twists which keeps the viewer at all times from figuring the ending out in one moment you think that something happens to coach jones or radio well it does but certainly not what youd expectbr br the film becomes at no point boring or too sentimental and the acting performances by ed harris  cuba gooding jr are some of their best in my opinion the ending puts a long lasting smile on your face and makes you wonder if what you are doing is right well i guess that was what michael tollin  mike rich were trying to do firstclass moviebr br esbjrn nordby birch denmark
