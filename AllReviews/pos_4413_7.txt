POS snap crackle pop the jarring sound of every change in camera angle and thats not to mention the white flashes and the clipped endings to almost every spoken sentence what on earth were they up to in the editing room or could it be that this approach was intentional surely not what purpose could it serve despite all its technical shortcomings this is an interesting film depicting a day in the life of joe a hustler determined to earn  for his wifes pregnant girl friend joe dallesandro is outstanding as the easygoing passive laidback young man who is willing to let the other person do most of the talking while he listens with a faraway look in his eyesbr br the story is meagre and sketchy documenting the uncertain life led by a man who relies on casual street sex to support his young wife and baby one thing is certain joe is uninhibited when it comes to disrobing for sex or posing for an artist understandably so for he has a handsome face and and equally handsome bodybr br there is a scene in the film that is remarkably effective there is no sound no dialogue joe stark naked is crouching on the floor feeding crumbs of cake to his little baby there is a beautiful serenity and tenderness captured in these quiet momentsbr br another scene of amusing interest is the one in which joe desperately seeks a loan of  from a gym friend coming to the point of asking in a very circuitous approachbr br joe tries to look interested but is hesitant in his conversation when an artist gives him a nonstop resume of greek and roman art its a preliminary to another occasion when joe divests himself of his clothes and poses as the discus thrower in true classical stylebr br at the end of the film we gain the impression that we have got to know joe pretty well after all he has uncovered more than his soul
