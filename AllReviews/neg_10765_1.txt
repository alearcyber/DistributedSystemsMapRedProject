NEG this is by far the most repulsive and atrocious version of the scarlet pimpernel ever to be devised as a pimpernel fan i was sincerely offended by what they did to the charactersbut this atrocity is not worth watching even if you arent familiar with the storybr br percy blakeney for example would never stab people in the back just to get down a hallway chauvelin would never have a string of women in his bed marguerite never had an affair with chauvelin nor armand with minette whoever the heck she is chauvelin would not randomly shoot tony in the head chauvelins name is not nor has it ever been paul they have completely eradicated any reference to the pimpernels disguises replacing them instead with james bondesque gadgets and gizmosbr br as to the film itself the makeup is horrifying the women look like clowns elizabeth mcgoverns beauty mark wanders around her face at random the poor pitiable actors have no script to work with so its not really their fault that their characters are as thin as wet tissue paper the dialogue oh the dialogue the dialogue is unbearable and whoever is responsible for all those little captions at the bottom of the screen should be forced to watch this movie as penance i counted  location captions in the first halfhour before i gave up as if we cant figure out that the body of water between england and france is the english channelbr br the filmif i can bring myself to call it that since its really just videotape with a filteris absolutely without redeeming value do not waste your time and brain cells on this rancid drivelinstead go watch the  anthony andrewsjane seymour version or the  leslie howard film or indeed anything but this one
