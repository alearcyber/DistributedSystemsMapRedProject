NEG usually im the one criticizing the twentysomething neanderthals for not being able to appreciate a film unless it has plastic tts gunfights and car chases however in this case the film might actually have been improved with a few of those additions at least i wouldnt have gotten bored after an hour and changed channelsbr br i dont mind surreal and i certainly dont mind having to pay attention to find subtlety or hidden meaning but there should be some point to the whole thing i didnt get the feeling that even the writer or director really had a broad vision of anything but were instead just so selfabsorbed in their own pretentious visions that they became deliberately scattered or perhaps they just got confused themselves either way i dont care it bored the crap out of me for just over an hour with no saving gracebr br although a whole pack of other viewers have filled up this site with excited ravings about the alleged symbolism and masterful cinematography i must respectfully disagree perhaps i didnt mince through enough film classes to appreciate some inspired techniques not visible to mere mortals br br or perhaps this movie was just crap br br i give it a  and file it next to ishtar
