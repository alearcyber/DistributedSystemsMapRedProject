POS to start off this happens to be my favorite of the st osbr br in addition to stuozs critical comments ill throw in some more getting technical when the enterprise fires its photon torps at a blind target theyd have to be mighty close to direct hits i believe in order to cause any disturbance much less damage to the romulan vessel with the vacuum of space to contend withbr br i had somewhat of a problem with the romulan commander questioning his faith in the romulan protocol or their leadership unless it has to do with attacking vulnerable targets outposts in the neutral zone that are not at war also i dont think commander would fall for the basic or simple tactics that kirk played such as playing dead or falling for the ploy that the subordinate puts on him about whether or not to attack the enterprise when it is playing deadbr br on the enterprise im surprised that after seeing the romulan vessels method of attack earlier that sulu would say are they surrendering when it attacks the enterprise the first timebr br funny how spock can only get the repair done on the weapons control right when the emergency is overbr br also in the final attack i thought the romulan vessel was uncloaked too long so long that spock could run down a couple aisles and back to the weapons room and activate and fire the photon torpedoes i would have used phasers at this point but im sure it had to do with the technicians and budgetbr br on the positive side its a good drama played on the romulan vessel in which to introduce us to the romulans great scenes with stiles telling a good deal of the human knowledge of the romulans also his conflict with spock is right up there i wished stiles character would have stayed on the show for a while if for nothing else than the energy he addedbr br its only in fun that i point out the negatives and goofs im sure there are more but for me this is as good as it gets balance of terror is always the one i place at the top in my st rankings
