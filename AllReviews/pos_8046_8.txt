POS the battle at elderbrush gulch was griffiths longest and most expensive short he had made up to that point in it we see him trying to perfect the largescale action scene that would be necessary in his fulllength features packing in all the elements that had made his previous action shorts successfulbr br griffith uses the western format  already the ideal backdrop for pure straightahead action set pieces  as the setting for his first epic battle like many westerns of the s the starting point is a character from the east heading out west  a device which perhaps helped ease the audience into the wilderness and here those easterners are a pair of children which was important for the type of picture this develops into for griffith you couldnt have action without a sense of vulnerability and here he crams it in with the kids from back east lillian gish as the distraught mother of the only baby in town and even some puppies that are at risk of ending up on the indians menubr br all this paves the way for an exceedingly complex and layered action sequence blending the trapped heroine scenario and the ridetotherescue with the battles that griffith had been depicting since his earliest civil war pictures in  there is a phenomenal amount going on here and griffith does very well at maintaining the exhilarating pace throughout and keeping everything coherent and logical however juggling x amount of elements in an action sequence does not necessarily make it that many times more exciting no matter how skilfully they are balanced and griffith did create better tensionsoaked finales before and after this onebr br but even a griffith picture so heavily focused on action would not be without its drama characterisation and atmospherics in the battle at elderbrush gulch the emotional setup is dealt with briefly but economically first we have the scene in which the waifs leave their home the cart they travel on heads away from the camera making use of depth and distance to express their moving away from safety and civilization an equally effective scene is the one in which we are introduced to the young family of gish bobby harron and their baby the people of the town coo over the precious tot then saunter off screen revealing that two indians were watching them from the background adding a sinister little note of dangerbr br of course many viewers today have pointed out the battle at elderbrush gulchs offensive portrayal of native americans in contrast with the more sympathetic red mans view but perhaps all is not what it seems first of all take a look at the indian chiefs sons waistcoat  its black and covered in shiny white dots it looks to me like a pearly kings jacket perhaps modified slightly for the warmer climate now have a look at the war dance they perform later on  it has a certain kneesup mother brown air to it these arent indians theyre cockneys so it shouldnt be offensive to native americans just cockneys
