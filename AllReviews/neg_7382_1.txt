NEG i found super troopers only mildly amusing at best seemed like a glorified police academy ripoff to me and i rented this movie in hopes of it being better it wasntbr br the writing is absolutely horrible and the pacing of this film is even worse it doesnt feel like a whole lot happens in this film or that it really gives us a reason to give a damn about any of the charactersbr br the actor who plays felix is totally uninspired though possibly due in part to the dialogue he had to work with in short this movie just went wrong in so many placesbr br i get the impression that since films like clerks independent filmmakers seem to think that they can make movies like this with long rambling scenes of dialogue where characters are trying to be funny but where dialogue in clerks pushes the story forward in this movie it hopelessly weighs it down films are supposed to have a decent balance of action and dialogue and as tempting as it is for filmmakers to try to have tons of snappy funny dialogue it just doesnt always work especially if theyre not that good at writing dialogue i hate to say it but even extreme heist was more interesting than this movie and that movie was so lowbudget it was shot on video
