NEG while the new pride  prejudice film is gorgeous to view and the soundtrack is lovely we are not seeing jane austens pride and prejudice the film is for some reason set back in the early s rather than the regency period where the novel is set as scholars have long shown the bennets longbourn estate is ramshackled and looks like cold comfort farm yet the bennets in the novel are gentry class they own a farm but the pig does not walk through the house nor is the farmyard of manure and chicken droppings contiguous to the home scenes are reset from the noveland lest we forget jane austen placed scenes in certain locations for a reason for example the film puts the big darcy proposal scene outside in a storm in front of a neoclassical temple as opposed to inside the collins parsonage why did jane austen put it in the parsonage because while lizzy and darcy speak with total if brutal honesty to each other in this scene the collinses have never shared an honest word why the rain and the outdoor proposal it looks like jane eyre meeting rochester and when elizabeth walks across a windy field to stand on a cliff and view the panorama one expects her to cry heathcliffe at any minute austen has been bronteized judy dench is a great actress but lady catherine is supposed to be tall and striking the petite tom hollander is a brilliant actor but mr collins is described in the novel as tall and heavylooking which suggests that his terrible dancing with poor lizzy is elephantine matthew macfayden is another favorite of mine from mi on ae in pp however he is more the young heathcliffe never smilingthough austen observes in the novel that darcy smiles at lizzy quite a bit and she realizes this when she sees his wonderful smiling portrait at pemberleya portrait that in this movie is for some reason replaced by a sculptured marble bustand much of austens dialogue is changed to modern speech mr bingley has been turned into such a clown that one wonders why darcy would have him as a friend and why jane bennet would love him the bottom line is that while this is a great movie to watch and hear it deviates from jane austens novel so much that any student who watched it thinking she could substitute viewing for reading would fail
