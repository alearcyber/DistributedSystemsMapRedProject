POS this movie is very long but totally worth splitting up over several nights it has an allstar cast and if you are a patrick swayze fan this will get your heart to throbbing  my mother is a civil war buff and a history teacher and every summer we would watch this movie we had recorded it off tv over several several nights until we got through the whole thing we had every line in the movie memorized lol pop some popcorn sit back and enjoy the action and romance its a great movie for those that like action war blood  guts but also for those with a soft romantic side the clothes the women wore were gorgeous sometimes i think i was born in the wrong era lol
