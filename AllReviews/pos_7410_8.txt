POS thought provoking humbling depiction of the human tragedies of war a small but altruistic view of one familys interactions with the enemy during the civil war in kentucky this movie lessens the glamor of war showing its effect on not only the soldier but the entire family unitbr br a lot of todays movies show war as an opportunity to highlight the heros and other glamorous features of war but very little attempts to show the true effect war actually takes on a community this movie attempts this through a retelling of a persons memory of those days this movie is stated to be loose translation of an actual events when in reality this movie is probably a factual reality of hundreds perhaps thousands of actual events during the civil war i highly recommend those interested in our civil war to watch this movie
