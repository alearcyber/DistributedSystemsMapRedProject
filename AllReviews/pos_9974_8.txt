POS the merchant of venice is one of shakespeares betterknown plays and is still regularly performed in the theatre incredibly however this film would seem to be the firstever englishlanguage version made for the cinema rather than television there were a number of versions made in britain or america during the early days of the cinema but these were all silentsbr br the reason for this neglect of the play may be connected with sensitivities about the plays alleged antisemitism a subject which has been even more sensitive since the rise to power of the nazis in  this may explain why all previous versions were made during the silent era in  or  it would have been easier to portray shylock as a straightforward villain than it would be today yet in my view the film is not antisemitic at all it should be remembered that during shakespeares lifetime there was no settled jewish community in england the jews had been expelled by edward i in the late th century and were not permitted to return until the time of cromwell some forty years after shakespeares death as far as we know shakespeare never travelled abroad so it seems quite possible that he himself never knew any jews personally or experienced the effects of antisemitism at first hand the play is not simply about the jewish question but is among other things an analysis of the corrosive effects of religious prejudice it may in fact be a coded examination of the mutual antipathy between catholics and protestants in tudor england something of which shakespeare certainly would have had firsthand experience and an appeal for greater tolerance between thembr br then as now traditional antisemitic stereotypes had always depicted jews as avaricious but shylocks principal sin is not avarice if it were he would certainly have accepted bassanios offer to pay him six thousand ducats twice the amount borrowed by antonio rather shylocks besetting sin is anger and the root of his anger is the way in which he and his fellowjews are treated by the christians of venice not only are jews in general regarded as secondclass citizens but jewish moneylenders such as shylock are particular targets for abuse even though the services they provide are necessary to the venetian economy the play shows the corrupting effects of prejudice not only do views of this sort corrupt the christians who hold them they can also corrupt the jews who suffer abuse shylocks vindictiveness is out of all proportion to the wrongs he has suffered by spitting on him and calling him a dog antonio behaves like a boorish bigot but boorishness and bigotry are not generally regarded as crimes deserving of the death penalty moreover shylock seeks to revenge himself on antonio not merely for the undoubted wrongs that antonio has done towards him but also for all the wrongs real and imaginary that he has suffered at the hands of the christian community such as his daughters marriage to lorenzo br br it is to the credit of the films director michael radford and of its star al pacino that they understand all these issues pacinos shylock has initially a sort of angry dignity about him that gradually gives way to vindictive rage and finally after his humiliation in the trial scene by portias reasoning to pathos we see clearly that he has been the instrument of his own destruction but we can still sympathise with him in my view none of pacinos performances that i have seen have ever equalled those he gave in the first two godfather films not scent of a woman for which he won an oscar and certainly not godfather iii but the merchant of venice is the one that comes closest to those benchmarks the other acting performance that stood out was lynn collinss luminous portia speaking her lines with great clarity and simplicity and bringing out the intelligence and resourcefulness that make her character more than simply a romantic heroine i was less impressed with jeremy ironss antonio who seemed too passive antonio is a complex character part loyal friend part melancholy contemplative part religious bigot and part enterprising capitalist although irons captured the first two of those aspects it was difficult to envisage his antonio either spitting on someone of a different faith or hazarding his all on risky trading ventures br br radfords interpretation of the play was attacked by the film critic of the daily telegraph who although he admired pacinos performance disliked the period setting and argued that shakespeare needs to be placed in a contemporary setting if it is to have relevance for a modern audience citing a recent stage production which set the action in weimar germany i would disagree profoundly with this approach the theatre and the cinema are quite different media and while there have been some striking modernist approaches to shakespeare in the cinema trevor nunns twelfth night comes to mind a traditionalist approach is often the best one i preferred for example zeffirellis romeo and juliet to baz luhrmanns the idea that we can only appreciate shakespeare in a modern guise is sheer intellectual laziness we are not prepared to make the effort to see our greatest writer in the context of the elizabethan society that produced him but rather prefer him dressed up as an ersatz twentiethcentury manbr br radfords traditional approach not only enables us to appreciate that bigotry and vindictiveness are ageold universal problems but also makes for a visually striking film in the play the scenes set in venice itself are characterised by turbulent action those set in portias country house at belmont are happier and more peaceful in the film the venetian exterior scenes were shot on location against a backdrop of misty wintry grey skies similar to the look achieved in dont look now the candlelit interiors with faces brightly lit against a dark background were reminiscent of the chiaroscuro effects of a caravaggio painting i suspect this was quite deliberate as caravaggio was a contemporary of shakespeare by contrast to dark or misty venice the belmont scenes shot in an enchanting palladian villa on an island in a lake were characterised by sunshine or peaceful moonlight br br this is one of the best shakespeare adaptations of recent years an intelligent and visually attractive look at a complex play br br a couple of errors we see a black swan on the water in front of portias house these birds are natives of australia and were not introduced to europe until well after  the date when the film is set also the portrait of portia in the leaden casket is painted in the style of the florentine botticelli who was active about a century before that date lynn collins may be reminiscent of a botticelli beauty but it seems unlikely that a late th century venetian lady would have had herself painted in the manner of late th century florence
