POS this game has cartoon graphics not much violence and really short levels  then why do people say it is so brilliant because it always holds your attention it captivates you and refuses to let go you will try for hours to try and find that damn flight recorder try to work out how to get into the room without alerting the guards etc the levels are short only when you know what to do  until that you will spend hours trying to figure out where to find correspondences where to find helicopters and so on and youll have fun all the while you are doing it well worth a rent
