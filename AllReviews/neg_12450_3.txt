NEG slowmoving ponderous movie with terrible acting on the whole  but lovely locations  clothes to admire and of course timothy dalton who does a compelling job as always i wanted to laugh out loud at the voiceovers  so silly but dalton is always worth watching even in bad movies a wonderful actor older now but still very handsome and masculine this movie is worth viewing only to see himand he seems like he wandered into a bad dime romance novel poor fellow your time would be better spent watching mr dalton in s wuthering heights or the early s bbc version of jane eyre poor sela ward so lovely but so wooden surely shes been better in other movies
