NEG the premise of this movie of a comedian talk show host running for president as an independent just to shake things up is funny entertaining brilliant and even a bit inspiring thought about the west wing debate when tom dobbs leaves his podium thought about steven colbert announcing his candidacy good times the first    minutes of this movie are therefore very very entertaining the debate especially when he eventually gets elected its a pity that is because of a computer glitch youd want him to win fair although that is unrealisticbr br but after that this movie goes completely downhill i thought wed get a great movie like dave  in which we see how it would out if a comedian actually ran the country instead the movie turns from comedy into a thriller a romantic comedy and a drama and does none good the computer glitch becomes the main storyline which really sucks boy is this disappointing i give it  stars just for the premise and because i actually managed to watch this movie from start to end without stopping it which is usually a good thing with me
