POS this has one of the more unusual plots ive seen in a horror film but its based on good solid universal studios fare lots of monsters pretty heroine torchbearing villagers but my favorite part is larry talbot the wolf man searching for the cure for his lycanthropy after dying in the original wolf man he is resurrected and wanders through frankenstein meets the wolf man and house of frankenstein searching for a way to end his affliction i think firsttime viewers will find his search in this particular movie very interestingbr br
