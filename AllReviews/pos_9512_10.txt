POS i dont know what dick steel was talking about but i found this film to be one of japans most thrilling epics to date as for armageddon or deep impact or for that matter the day after tomorrow is pale in comparison for what i know of films most of the catastrophes in films are basically run of the mill asteroid flicks or one of which of global warming this how ever ran a different course a course of natural means where the earths crust is beginning to erode to such a degree that it will take another piece of land with it for the ride what the scientific teams had to do was create a way to stop the erosion from going to far and sinking japan altogether in most cases this would simply be called tectonic shifting on steroids i found the characters rather appealing in every way from the child who lost her mother only to face her own demise among unfamiliar friends or the rescue girl who does all the she can to save lives in the face of disaster or a man who thought he could change her mind not to be such a dare devil and go with him to safety only to become the hero himself and save his homeland and lets not forget how the rest of the world just shucked them all back only to be forgotten by having the world turning their backs on the japanese citizens who cried for help this was a great movie in all aspects what dick is trying to say is that this movie was not hollywood made that it was made in japan that it had characters which rival other actors around the world that the effects are very gorgeous as he mentioned but its all he was waiting for and nothing else he lacks the vision of whats important to everyone and why this film had every element of feeling of grandeur and of humanity i thought this film was top rate and i have seen many disaster films to know that japan sinks was possibly one of the most original and well thought out projects i have witnessed i really hope shinji higuchi will make another of such films oh and by the way i am not japanese though in many ways i wish i was i am canadian born and raised and an avid movie buff in all aspects predjudicial visions are bitter and not worth the effort to be recognized as an opinion dick you should watch it with a more open heart and mind dont just look for the eye candy which makes a films content look for whats more important and understand it they may not be american but the japanese have cornered the market lately for some of the most breath taking and down right gritty film making to date which is why spending  is just what the doctor ordered you heard right  to make this film now you tell me was it worth it or was it worth it because american actors werent in it
