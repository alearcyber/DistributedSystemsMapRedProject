NEG being a longtime steve martin fan it hurt to see him in a movie with such a cliched script the screenwriter must have just rented some videos and taken a piece here and a piece there  it certainly is about the least imaginative movie ive seen in a long time  i knew exactly what was going to happen in each scene as soon as it began the africanamerican stereotypes and slave references are pretty offensive as well but the thing that was the worst for me was to see martin in a movie without a trace of wit he probably is one of the most intelligent actors and here he totally sold out to a totally dumbed down script he must be behind in his alimony to be in such a lame effort
