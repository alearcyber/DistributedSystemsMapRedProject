NEG this sequel is quite awful to be honest im a fan of kungfu movies and this is by far the worst ive seen bride with white hair  was actually quite good and this is a huge disappointment bwwh  was brilliant in some ways with an unique oddball evil bad guybr br the couple from the first movie played a small role in this movie instead the movie revolves around a bunch of uninteresting characters trying to seek revenge on their fallen clans but theres no antagonist in this movie so the revenge is mutebr br the worst part to this movie is the kungfu or lack there of they literally had a street style knife fight the character at the end refused to fight because there was lack of choreography
