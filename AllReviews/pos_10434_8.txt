POS the last american virgin  was one of the few teenage comedies that i really enjoyed the subject matter and the acting was well above the usual tripe that hollywood was and still is cranking out these days but for awhile the smaller studios were producing movies about teenagers that wasnt toned downed or soften for the kiddies the men pulling the strings behind this production were from your friends from cannonbr br three teenage buddies are trying to lose their virginity whilst still in high school theyll do anyone or anything to achieve their dream goal the sensitive one of the group andrew monsoon whats to find the right girl while his two best friends will take whatever they can get one day the kid finds his perfect girl diane franklin but fate would play one of their foul tricks his best friend moves on in and sweeps her off of her feet after knocking her up the sensitive kid helps the girl get back on her feet and pays for her abortion he still has feelings for her and tries to win her heart meanwhile his best friend has a very violent falling out over getting her dream girl preggers still he tries his best to get her to love him the night comes when he pops the question to her but his heart is shattered when he sees her dancing with his former best friend in tears the kid leaves the partybr br what i enjoyed about this movie was that it pulled no punches instead of being filled with phony situations it was very realistic honest and brutal the movies filled with its share of funny moments and hysteria i have to recommend this film for fans of teenage comediesbr br highly recommended
