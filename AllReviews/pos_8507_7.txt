POS ive seen nsna just after ive seen all roger moorefilms and i must say that it felt so good to see connery again he proves for all times that he is the one and only bondbr br the film itself isnt really a masterpiece but it is really worth watching the jokes sit much better here the effects are funny and interesting connery is connery and brandauer is really a good villain but von sydow is just wasted and the score is not often good and there are a few scenes that seem pretty unnecessarybr br
