NEG a roger corman ripoff assembled for what appears to be virtually zero budget all of the special effects were originally used in battle beyond the stars and i suspect a fair amount of the props costumes and sets were reused from other sources as well the story seems to have been written around these elements so this isnt really a movie as much as its a recycling project thirdrate star wars junk wasnt needed then or now
