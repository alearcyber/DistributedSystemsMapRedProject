NEG no one can say i wasnt warned as i have read the reviews both user  external but like most of us attracted to horror movies curiosity got this cat come on we all scream at the people in the movie not to go into the dark room but you know thats horror aficionados are always dying to know whats in there even if we know itll be badbr br the bottom line is that this movie left me angry not because it pretends to be real who caresgimmicks are allowed or because the actors and dialogue are so lame is this an unusual event in horror movies or even because the movie is so bad and i am being polite here what really got me mad is that the film is not only a rip off of bwp but also a halfhearted lazy rip off at thatbr br i dont believe in sacred cows and if they thought they could outdo bwp then kudos to them but they didnt even try the movie was made with little effort or care and that is the most unforgivable sin in horror or any movie
