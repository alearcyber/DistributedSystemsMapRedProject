POS this is a film about loneliness and how the distance  physical and emotional  between people tends to stultify relationshipsbr br the narrative is simple to the point of banality a young man yusuf emin toprak from a rural village arrives in istanbul to stay with his older and successful cousin mahmut muzaffer ozdemir yusuf wants work in the big city after trying for a few weeks to find work without any success the strain of having yusuf living with him is too much for mahmut they quarrel  nothing physical just verbal eventually yusuf goes leaving mahmut alone again end of storybr br except for the fact that the performance of the two men as relatives is one of the best on film much is said visually dialog is used to bring out disagreement distrust hostility and insecurity that exist within and between the two menbr br there are many visual gems in this film for example while searching for work young yusuf needing a relationship tries in vain to gain the attention of various young women around the city the look on his face as he is thwarted every time says it allbr br or wanting a cigarette yusuf opens the door to the balcony of mahmuts apartment and lights up in the frigid december air leaving the door open mahmut eventually gets up from his work desk walks to the door all glass and the cousins just look at each other for what seems way too long a time then mahmut closes the door leaving yusuf out in the cold the metaphor is completebr br or mahmut cleaning up after yusuf grudgingly and with increasing anger and all the while yusuf wastes his time chasing skirts instead of looking seriously for work and spends mahmuts money on a toy for a nephew yusuf is emotional untidy impulsive and vulnerable mahmut is rational logical selfconfident and a demanding control freak the rightbrain leftbrain dichotomy beautifully played out by two actors who say more with a look a gesture a frown than any words can conveybr br but mahmut is not completely emotionless he still loves his exwife who tells him that shes off to canada with her husbandtobe mahmut affects a distant and confident friendship with his ex and makes sure that she is okay about going he wishes her well he says goodbye he leaves the coffee shop where they were talking later when she calls to say a last goodbye on the way to the airport mahmut goes there and secretly watches as she leaves the poignancy of the emotion on his face as she disappears through a door is worth the waitbr br all in all this is a standout piece of work by the two main actors and the director nuri ceylan some might argue that the pace is too slow but life goes slowly for much of the time especially for those who are alone the camera work is relatively simple also choose the scene set up the camera and lighting and let the actors move across the scene enter the scene and leave the scene all the while keeping the camera still there were a few panning shots some highangle tracking shots a few rural scenes  but much of the film is shown as though on a stage with a fixed camera and a wide angle lens except for tv and radio music within the story there is no music sound track and there are those many long silences as the two men sit and watch tv together andor engage in very limited conversationbr br i saw this movie on tv so i was amused to see that on a few occasions i was watching tv as they were watching tv also the silence in the movie matched the silence in my house i was awake all others in bed my chair and position matched that of mahmuts as he watched tv quite eerie giving me a sense of almost being there with him and i guess i was in a sensebr br ill say no more because i want you to savor the other scenes that i havent described its not a movie for everybody for sure more than any movie ive seen it shows just how much we die when we are all alone  just as we are all alone when we die mahmuts face as it fades to black in the final scene will stay with me for a long long timebr br highly recommended for serious movie buffs
