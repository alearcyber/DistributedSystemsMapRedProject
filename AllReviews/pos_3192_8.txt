POS i first saw love in limbo playing late on free to air tv about five years ago and since then its a movie ill always remember warmly as one of those films you see and are forever influenced bybr br for the uninitiated australian film has a long history of making offbeat comedies about lovable losers and love in limbo is a sterling example of this whilst russel crowe is the only name actor in it although these days hes all a movie needs the rest of the aussie cast is good he still steals the show as a nervous nerdy virgin loser thoughbr br the general premise is a lot like american pie a group of friends wanting to get laid and become men as youd expect the entire movie focusses on this with a subplot about the leads mother and various other incidents and is full of humorous situations that push it towards the inevitably sweet endingbr br if you enjoyed american pie dont expect this to be the same but expect the same conventions to make appearances love in limbo isnt a gross out romantic comedy but it definitely has its share of laughs fist pumping moments when the good guy wins and the situations every guy australian or otherwise can relate tobr br see it if you liked american pie almost famous strengths good aussie cast easy to relate to good perve value weaknesses predictable at points my rating  out of
