POS cummings is falsely accused of sabotage and goes on the lam looking for the real culprit the familiar hitchcock theme of a man wrongly accused of a crime is nicely played out in this entertaining fare that has elements of the thirty nine steps and north by northwest although it is not as good as either of those classics there are some impressive set pieces including the finale on the statue of liberty the plot is implausible and unconvincing and after a terrific start it seems to run out of steam cummings is likable if somewhat stiff in the lead lane is the blonde but not the cool variety of the directors later films the supporting roles are generally well played
