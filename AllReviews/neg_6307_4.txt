NEG dennis quaid is tryin hard to prove us that jerry lee lewis was a dumb guy and hes doing too much to prove it tv sequences are very good like a photocopy of old black and white footages music is fine too because mr lewis himself is singing but the rest is just hollywood bmovie style with the fifties happy days complex i think the only good thing in this movie is to see young winona ryder
