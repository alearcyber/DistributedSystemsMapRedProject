POS this is a great documentary and above comments make a brief summary of how great it was so i wont repeat the same compliments but faith akin being an turkish oriented guy who probably knows about that country more than an ordinary european falls into the trap of orientalism that other western artists usually fall but come on man you are turkish blooded and your movie could be deeper and could describe whats beyond beyogluold town its a missed opportunity for akinfor that reason performances by muzeyyen senar and orhan gencebay are peek of the movie and ceza a very talented and bad ass turkish rapper makes some trash talk about american gangsta rappers which i totally agree i will recommend this movie to my american friends
