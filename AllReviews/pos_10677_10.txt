POS i saw this movie in the early s when i was about  yrs old on tv it was on after school and as i watched i was so drawn into the whole idea of the two astronauts going on a mission to another undiscovered planet that i asked my mom if i could get the cassette recorder out she let me so i wrapped the cord of the mic around the channel knob so the mic was hanging in front of the speaker this movie is the first one i ever paid enough attention to  and cared enough about to record just the audio  there were no vcrs at the time the plot will have you hanging onto every word every minute of this film the ending will blow your mind after watching the journey to the far side of the sun you will have flashbacks in your mind about it for a long time i did replay the audio recording for many years and saw it over and over in my mind then  maybe  years later when vcrs were common and they sold tapes in stores i always looked for it but never found it but when the internet came along one day i searched for it and purchased it in a second so after about  years after seeing it for the first time  i got to see it again wow it was spectacular just for reference i must have watched it  times since
