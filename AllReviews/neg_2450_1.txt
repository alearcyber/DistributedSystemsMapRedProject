NEG i ticked the contains spoiler box in case i say anything that is a spoiler and dont realise ive said it until i reread it after ive posted so its just in casebr br anyhow back to reviewing this filmbr br i saw this film on skymovies earlier on this afternoon and by the description sky gives you these people must be on acid it sounded pretty good but then when i actually got about  minutes into it i was appalled this film in my opinion has the worst scriptwriting and actorsactresses  ever the young girl who falls in love with the boy from la after about  hours is a really stupid lame character who has an annoying whiney voice and boff hair  then theres her lover whos an idiot and is also very whiney actually maybe they suit each other then theres the boys mum whos with him on holiday and surprise surprise  shes a doctor and  oh my god wait theres even more unsuspected surprises a virus suddenly breaks out on the island and she knows all about viruses o shock horror yeah right lol then theres this insane religious lad who keeps going on about erbs or something and how the lord knows all everyone on the island seems to love him yet hes actually a stubborn arrogant steroidpumped you really need to watch this film just for the scene where he comes out of the sea after a swim his head is like tiny and his body is massive its hilarious buffoon whos had way too much to drinkbr br anyhow after all these weirdo characters including a stonedlooking taxi driver the religious lad finally gives in to the doctor and she takes a blood sample and they get straight to work on finding the cure from that because for some reason hes dramatically been saved all down to erbs and god and oh my god yes theres another surprise youll never guess what just in the nick of time with  minutes to go before everybody on the island drops dead infact including her son and his girl she finds the cure and injects everybody and its all resolved what a pathetic film i mean i knew it sounded an obvious ending from when i first started watching it but i actually though itd be good and have some subplot twists somewhere but nono it was just boring and drybr br dont watch this film youll end up like me  stunned for  hours and then demanding the hour and a half you spent of your life watching it back
