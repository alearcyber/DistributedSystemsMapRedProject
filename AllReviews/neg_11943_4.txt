NEG yes i spelled that right this movie is so predictable the actual word needs additional letters to exemplify the predictability from the moment the principal characters and situation are introduced it is paintbynumbers as to where this plot will take us the foreshadowing was as subtle as a two ton sledgehammer you could take numerous pieces of dialogue and anticipate the role it would play in the endingbr br catherine zetajones and aaron eckhardt did decent jobs in undemanding roles and abigail breslin played the cute role admirably its just that the movie brought absolutely nothing new to the romantic comedy genre the romance was tepid and the laughs were weak and few sure its an ok movie if you have nothing to watch but you wont miss anything by missing this one
