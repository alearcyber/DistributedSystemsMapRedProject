POS this is one of my all time favorite cheap corny vampire b movies br br calvin klein underwear modeloh i mean stefan the good vampire returns to transylvania to ascend the throne of vampiric royalty but manicureimpaired and eternally drooling half brother radu has other plans having killed their father the vampire king radu now sets his sights on stefan stefans new mortal girlfriend michelle and her two pretty friends and the allpowerful bloodstonebr br okay the scenery is beautiful and it should be as it was shot on location in transylfrickenvania for gosh sakes the actresses are no great shakes and stefan the heroic vampire is about as charming as a refrigerated fireplace poker but who cares theres only one reason to watch this movie and his name is radu hes a physical homage to nosferatu and he has the best lines in the movie all spoken in the raspy voice of a man who smokes ten packs of cigarettes a day the cemetery festival scene is one of the best scenes in the film as radu slowly approaches the camera and reveals his grinning slobbering face for the world to see i found myself cheering him on as he collected victims and taunted his perfect brother but maybe im just a sicko questionable taste in men aside i highly recommend this film to vampire enthusiasts its original its fun and radu is one of the best vampires ive seen in a long timemuch more fun than the stiff tragic whining undead brats that endlessly grace the horror screens these days radu enjoys his sadism and never apologizes hes what a vampire should be
