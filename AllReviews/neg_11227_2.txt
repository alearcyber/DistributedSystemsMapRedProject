NEG ive seen worse which is a backhanded way of saying how crummy this film was the plot is ridiculous a student shoots a police officer and five more take him hostage in a dimlylit smoky new york school  and somehow this clichd hostage situation takes  hours to resolve are you serious a daylong hostage situation  with a wounded nypd officer no less takes all day i realize this film was made pre but still i looked at the clock and wondered how they could possibly drag this overdone plot on for another hour and  minutesbr br the acting was mediocre at best allaround and the characters were seemingly thought up by th graders the childabuse kid the pregnant scared girl the violent gang wannabe a confused unfortunate victim the wisecracking white guy pleasebr br trying to make this hostage situation into a mission for more textbooks and better school conditions please  this is a weak attempt to justify writing a movie about a kid who shoots a cop theyre confused ignorant idiots who get involved in a dumb  farfetched  situation dont try and paint them suddenly as noble the most laughable is ziggy who lives in the schools attic and admires michaelangelo so much so that he paints these striking scenes on the walls youve got to be kidding mebr br the no racism signs in the protesting crowd a black kid shoots a black cop and a black negotiator tries to patch it all up this is a random messagebr br i understand the overall message which was poorly portrayed albeit by some actors who have gone on to respectable careersbr br this was a joke though the red sniper lasers on the roof the worst scene was the kid fake snow falling dying in the arms of his buddy on the roof promise me etc how originalbr br the epilogue of i went to prison but now im prelaw at xyz university  a fitting way to end a joke of a movie
