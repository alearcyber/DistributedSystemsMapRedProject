POS the melancholy of haruhi suzumiya is an anime that left quite the impression on me partially for the characters many of whom fall into anime fantasyscifi stereotypes but placing these stereotypes in the rather mundane setting of high school is a twist that i appreciated then theres the somewhat insane titular character who is something else a headstrong almost amoral girl with ridiculous amounts of talent and a secret that shes not aware ofbr br the setup for the series is a bit of a mindtrip essentially suzumiya unbeknown to herself is a sort of superpowerful being capable of godlike feats of creation and destruction as she can destroy and rebuild reality to her whim our narrator and primary character is kyon a high schooler whose sympathycuriosity for haruhi appears to cause her to drag him against his will into a club shes starting to spice up her life because shes bored with the normal life searching for adventure she claims three more unusual members each with secrets and they all end up being dragged into her crazy schemesbr br there is a bit of crazy but enjoyable philosophic consideration early on as we debate whether the world is merely haruhis creation as she gets bored of the old one and whether our characters exist to serve her or serve her to continue to exist or whether they could exist without her its a bit of a conundrum but an enjoyable one all the same while scififantasy scenarios do occasionally occur in the series i think the joy of the series lies in how normal things are while there remains this tension in knowing that if things are too boring haruhi might destroy the world in hopes of making it more interestingbr br the art is clean and in line with what ive come to expect from the anime that typically gets imported to the us i like the character designs and while there isnt a whole lot of action in the series i think it sits better that way the series is narrated from the mind of kyon and he doesnt play an omniscient narrator but only comments on what he knows and what he feels hes has a lot going on in his head but he doesnt actually speak a whole lot so its good that we get to hear itbr br the voice acting in the english dub is acceptable enough but i prefer the japanese acting over it there are some stranger aspects to the series some of which both parodies and traffics in fanboyism which i found amusing for the first season i have to admit that theres a lack of closure as the series doesnt really have an larger story arc but seems to take things one at a time so its an easy series to pick up and put down although i think that because of its rather entertaining qualities its still quite hard to put down its also based on a series of light novels and the author was directly involved in the writing of the seriesbr br even though its based on the novels i still wish that the over series had stronger story arcs but i love how naturally we get to watch these characters develop and how well the series can play out the quiet moments as well as the crazier ones seeing haruhi grow herself was quite a treat as well as watching the relationships develop between the sos brigade haruhis clubbr br its not for everyone due to its mindtwisting premise and extraordinary beings in a mundane world setting it probably wont sate fanboys who are into actionscififantasy and might be a little too offkilter for the more relationshiporiented drama lovers but for those willing to try out something a little different or that like strangely quirky series like this i think the melancholy of haruhi suzumiya is a rather refreshingly unique and enjoyable series more please
