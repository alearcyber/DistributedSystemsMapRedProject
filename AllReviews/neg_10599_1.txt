NEG i heard what people were saying but i ignored them being rushed at blockbuster i grabbed copy of this movie and ran out br br  minutes into i was fighting to stay awake there is some attempt to keep the film interesting but it was just bad a chase of some sort takes place but it was long and drawn out  the perfect time to make a snack by the time this movie was over i didnt care how ended i just wanted it to end walking in and out of my room checking to see if it was overbr br the entire movie is a cliche the characters and their relationships the plot twists are predictable as well as the ending the actors made the best out of really terrible roles all can say is their clothes were nice but the movie it was just bad
