POS i went to the movies to see claudine and loved every minute of it the cast and the soundtrack as well diahann carroll was never better than in this role we saw ms carroll downplayed her looks barely saw her nakedsmoked a cigarette drank beer and oh she cursed whenever this movie was shown on tv and finally cable i would call my friends to watch it just the soundtrack from the very beginning of the movie is awesome all thanks to gladys knight and the pips we saw a black woman struggling to raise her children dealing with teen pregnancy and everyday life meets a man whom she learns later on has issues himself finally this movie made it to dvd and well deserving
