POS this film is a powerful commentary on family life in north america today the story is so well constructed it almost feels like its happening across the street right now if you are connected with your family and community in any way this film will grab you and transport you to the travis home and not allow you to leave until the credits are donebr br our imaginary heroes through a myriad of innocent circumstances often unwittingly lead us down a path of sorrow confusion and isolation the travis family after a terrible tragedy invite each of us father mother brother and sister into their respective lives to share their experience in a dynamic set of circumstances that just doesnt quit we see all of the above and eventually the joy in powerful performances by the major players and the rest of the cast making this film a moviegoers absolute treasurebr br in a film so well done as this it is usually difficult to to find something special but sigourney weavers portrayal of sandy travis was outstanding i would be surprised if others didnt recognize it as suchbr br clearly a  well done
