NEG extremely formulaic with cosmicsized logic holes and a pretense at comedy aw poor nyc lawyer hes just scraping by and when he gets a reduction in pay he doesnt go out to find another job though hes one of the most respected lawyers in the area we see him arguing in court so that others come up and congratulate him on his fiery winning delivery but he cant stand up to anyone in his firm at home problems are ignored until people storm out of the housebr br the only character you want to root for is the final maid who seems an actual human being who uses logic and communication to survive in the world how laughable that the maid should bring the lawyer and his wife a chicken and wine on new years eve because she feels sorry for them the bits not played for laughsbr br sorry just too unbelievable and with a spoiler pat everyoneturnsdegrees ending howd they get topnotch stars for this if id been at the studio id have sent this one back for a complete rewrite
