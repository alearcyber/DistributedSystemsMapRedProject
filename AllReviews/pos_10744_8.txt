POS hi being able to speak cantonese i found this very funny and was able to all the jokes that one might not get due to language barriers the fight scenes are spectacular and its a good movie however i have my criticisms first of all i find that it is not as good as the first one project a go and see that now  reason is spoilers aheaddont read on if you havent seen the film because in project a jackie ends by fighting his enemy the man he is sent to kill sanpao that is what he has been striving to do all the film and the showdown is spectacular but in a ii hough he fights chan the showdown scene between jackie and his nemesis is not long enough and the bulk of the action is against the empresss men they are not nearly as bad enough and have only played a minor part in the film in relation to jackie so though their fight sequence is spectacular they are not the ones jackie is hunting throughout the whole of the film so thus leaving the viewer slightly unfulfilled however this is just my humble opinion so dont take it word for wordgo and see it yourself it is a great film in its own right take care and hope your admiration for jackie grows yours sincerely ian ps you know the police chief in a ii hes the same guy in first strikenice to know hes still going strong
