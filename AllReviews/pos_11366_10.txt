POS i followed this entire series when i was a child in grade school by choice not because it was required for school i used to read the plays at the pace of the series the experience gave me a lifelong love for shakespeare and history it even gave me a bit of an acting bug although at an amateur level only whenever i read any of shakespeares history plays the images that come to mind first are from this black and white production seen on a big furniture tv set with a rabbit ear antenna with all the ghosts and wobbles that go with thatbr br although the sets were minimal if i remember correctly that was totally irrelevant because the acting was so good at the time i had no idea who any of the actors were now i see that many of them have become well known over the years i particularly enjoyed hotspur and hal whom i now see were played by sean connery and robert hardy i would dearly love to see this available in video especially since many of the plays are seldom performed and even fewer are available on video it would be valuable also as a document of midth century televised play production
