NEG this adaption contains two parts br br  the now time when gulliver is at home in england and soon is put into a mental asylum by the evil dr bates br br  the described time in which gulliver describes his travelsbr br the times are interspersed with a very choppy tempo which makes willing suspense of disbelief far more difficult than it would have been if the movie simply would have discarded that part and followed the book as written in the book there is no dr bates no asylum and mrs gulliver gets very little mention the travels  in plural  are depicted as one in the movie there are several movies covering the topic of sane people dumped into asylum by some nasty person out there look at them if you want that stuff the now time part adds absolutely nothing to the storys value is a complete invention by the movie adapters and takes valuable time from the real story all the time when this was going on i was longing for the next bit of real travel to be shownbr br so much for the drawbacks the parts which actually are part of the real story are well done and the cgi is really well done for its time many small and a few mediumsized parts of the real travels are simply cut out but that does not make the story halt this is afaik the only version which depicts all four travels and for that the movie should get special mention br br the two interspersed parts get approximately equal time i rate the first part  out of  and the actual travel coverage as  averaging out i give it a  if only they would have cut the rubbish and focused  on the actual travels since that cut would have freed up a lot of time much better spent on filling in the details cut from the travels br br why some adapter think that he is gifted enough to improve upon swifts work i do not know my best guess is that cgi was so costly back in  so that the movie company felt a need to incorporate a lot of filler which did not need elaborate sets gci etc in order to keep total costs under some limit while at the same time producing a miniseries which clocked in at some set number of minutes
