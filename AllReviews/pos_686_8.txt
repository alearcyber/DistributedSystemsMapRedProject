POS this one is a hilarious diamond in the rough the acting and plot arent that impressive but the lines just keep on coming this catches a lot of flack because it seems at first glance like well a bad movie but its so kooky that you cant help but be amused the spastic lightening quick dialog and quirky characters keep it going i was especially fond of sharon the canuck on shrooms eh however the one that really stole the show was richards little brother andrew ira heiden his high pitched whining was somehow endearing the whole movie rocked
