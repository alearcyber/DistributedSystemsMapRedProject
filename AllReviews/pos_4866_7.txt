POS as i have said before in previous comments some programmes are there to be light entertainment so i get somewhat frustrated when commentators seem to be expecting a program that will reveal the meaning of life you will not get that from cleopatra  and it does not presume to offer it what you get is a girl who was frozen and is brought back to life some  years later and her adaptation to this new life is realistic she does not settle in within  minutes as what happens with other time travelling adventures and neither is she the female equivalent of james bond ready to take on all comerscleopatra is overawed by her new surroundings and frightened by some of the weaponry on display as most of us would be however it is light entertainment the stories have a beginning a middle and an end in quick time and their are some surprisingly good moments of acting the episode when there is a double of cleopatra is particularly moving and jennifer sky i think gives one of the best performances of someone dying for a long long time and being a film and television buff i know what i am talking about finally to prove my sincerity i have purchased all but four of the episodes and i am entirely satisfied with my purchase the only reason i do not have the complete set is because i purchased the other episodes before realising that there was one complete box set victoria pratt and gina torres complete the trio creditably and for light entertainment cleopatra  certainly entertained me
