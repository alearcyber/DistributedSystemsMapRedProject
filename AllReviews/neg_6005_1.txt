NEG ok first said i just wanted to check whether this movie has an average rating below or exactly  but  this is sicker than any of the killers proceedings   that made me curious what people wrote here which in the end made me set up an account to give my cents of truth into this well of delusion i find herebr br how dare you guys even mention this movie in the same sentences as eg seven the only thing they got in common is that they show various crimescenes thatisit and best thriller of   have you even watched another movie form that year or any other movie in your life at all  is not a year which people are reminded of by resurrection whats with actual movies like mm eyes wide shut arlington road double jeopardy theyre actually more a thriller than this one could ever be resurrection does not even deserve to be dedicated to a second of br br really you guys cant be serious i watched that movie yesterday with my girlfriend highly recommended by a friend of her a great film with christopher lambert which i had not yet seen hmm br br well first look on the covers ok nothing special at second glimpse you dont need to have supernatural powers to be aware that they simply mirrored lamberts head clipped his nose n thisthat then made a fancy negative pattern on top of it to get the killers image on the cover you could even think they had some apprentice eat a gallon of marshmallows just to caption that creepy booooh   mouth whatever turned it around and the plot starts with its raining in chicago blabber blabber come on a six year old could have made that snippet sound more exciting now with this enormous excitement coming from the movies terrific presentation   you absolutely wanna start watching it because it cant be that bad it still is christopher lambert that assumption of mine was proved wrong with proven wrong i mean it was brutally executed by a deadly mix of the worst imaginable acting ever known to mankind every actor but the tops are the i can do liners police chief prudhommes wife  actually a better detective than prudhomme when she recombines several incidents to a yet absolutely unknown hint in the case   and  yes prudhomme himself featuring a squadron of inhuman fake feelings logic errors in a minutecycle lightyears farfetched conclusions which in my pointofview represent an insult to any thinking human being and last but not least a cameraman who obviously was a hyperventilating kangaroo oh well and if you do not completely shut down your brains these arent premises to watch it then you should know who is who and what is what after max minutes simply because you know any scene after the first that is thrilling thrilling because this movie almost makes you think you can tell the future br br the bottom line this is by far the worst movie i can remember trust me ive seen many horrible movies which in some way were at least only bad attempts or bad copies of another movie resurrection however is the best example on how to fail in every aspect possible it was so bad that after being shocked by its unimaginably low quality in everything i laughed more often than in any recent comedy simply because i was fascinated by the crews brazenness to publish such an extraordinary film strip good thing for lambert he was in highlanderendgame a year later thus he can be pardoned obr br anyhow i do recommend watching this movie to everyone in the end we had great fun watching it d i guarantee you after you completely watched resurrection be brave you can do it  you will worship the level of acting in any given daily soap br br or just go n watch highlander one more time thats what im gonna do
