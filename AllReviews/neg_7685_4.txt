NEG ivan the terrible is more a filmed stage play than a bigscreenopus citizen kane  a similar work in many ways  is quite the opposite in the way we come to expect such fare in that it has lots of location shooting for examplebr br acting is meant to convey a characters motivations and thinking to the audience if it succeeds in making you understand the character what does it matter how it was done and considering the low amount of action how else is one to express events that influence the story and consequently the characters machinations and decisions other than exaggerated movementsbr br as well theres a historical level why the acting style should not surprise the rise of totalitarian regimes in germany and ussr forced filmmakers who stayed behind to make films the way they knew how as they were prevented access to more modern works that showed cinemas evolution and techniques they only used what they knewbr br the nazis control of government in germany destroyed the great german film industry of the s due to their total control over that film industry and propaganda films can only entertain german troops so much hence the need for popular german silent films of the s for example so a lot of ivan the terrible films techniques would have been derived from such captured german films supplied to the film crew as mentioned in other commentsbr br there was no confusion anywhere and though personally it was found overhyped it is by no means a bad cinematic experience  and definitely not amongst the worse films ever the acting is fine and part of the cinematography excellent even by todays standards more below definitely not a popcorn flick one cant leave their brain outside this ones door dated perhaps and very symbolic  only worth watching on the big screen if one is unable to view the films with the lights off at home for many of the cinematic elements will be lost in these films chiefly bw experience it all depends upon what expectations one walks in withbr br warning  spoilers do not read the following comments in case they influence your personal view of the filmsbr br and if one does not mind the obvious communist propaganda as opposed to capitalist propaganda for ivan is how stalin saw himself  obvious in his influence on the films direction see other comments  and anyone with a world historical awareness outside the us perspective will definitely understand this maybe ivan was an earlier incarnation of stalin or maybe not this is more a diatribe on stalin and his motivations decisions loneliness promotions of lackeys etc  using the persona of ivan  than any true historical record of ivan also note the obvious use of particular colours in the sequel red for the ussr in the banquet scene and perhaps blue for the usa during certain shots when the usurper wears the crownbr br but it has many excellent visuals such as the profound use of shadows or the exterior shot of the populace coming to beg ivans return to moscow
