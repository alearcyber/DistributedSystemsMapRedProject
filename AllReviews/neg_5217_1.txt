NEG boring rank nefarious plot some of the worst direction ive ever come across inane acting and horribly clichd the movie ends with one of the main characters waking from a dream whats with that even jr from dallas couldnt survive that lame twist br br you have what can only be described as an inappropriate relationship developing between a main character and a young girl which is ostensibly meant to be fatherly but which comes off as perverse you have freshman community college movie school special effects with loopholes the size of the kimberly hole this is like children of the corn meets passion of the christ imposed on an endless loop of government administration training video  by the end of it if you arent contemplating ending it you have no brainbr br dont bother
