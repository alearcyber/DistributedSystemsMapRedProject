POS i just saw this at the philadelphia film festival it was the most wonderful movie  the best ive seen in quite a while the enticing character of isa is an open exploring and as remarked in the film lovefilled person  guilelessly portrayed by the beautiful camille natta the accompanying music is soothing and transporting a balm to the soulbr br each character seems to be conflicted in some way  and their interactions w conflicts make for a great story the tale told by ak hangal as the old man was most magically done  i wanted it to go on and onbr br that hari seemed to remember his place throughout added get power to the story  a refreshing change to the bubbleheaded plots of many modern writersbr br all and all an excellent film go see
