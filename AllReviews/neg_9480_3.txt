NEG oh yes i admit i have made myself guilty of the crime of seeing this piece of trash i cant say i was forced by aliens who pointed a gun at my head tied me to a chair and made it impossible for me to close my eyes and then turned this awful excuse for a movie on no i did it with free will i deliberately tortured myself lets go through the fact here folks  the acting is an insult to humanity  the plot if it exists is ridiculous  the character development is horrendous  the characters that appear in the movie are so clichd you would br br recognize them in your average comic book  the editing is sloppy and unimaginative  the camerawork is low key  the dialogue is simply the worst in cinematic history  the directing well lets say i bet it wasnt hitchcockbr br then to add to these facts there was absolutely no talent involved wath so ever the director must be smoking crack now to forgive himself for inflicting this poison to the world br br bottom line passport to paris is one of the worst movies ever made permanent
