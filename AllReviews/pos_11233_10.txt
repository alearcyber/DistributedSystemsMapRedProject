POS the polish brothers are unique film artists and theyve really pushed the envelope here a fantasy that has points in common with wings of desire northfork tells the story of a s era small town in the middle of nowhere that is two days shy of being inundated and submerged thanks to the us governments desire to make a reservoir on the place where the town stands its a wry parable about loss and remembrance featuring angels dreams premonitions and the most hilarious government reclamation functionaries since repo man the performances are all outstanding especially nolte and woods ive noticed in reading down some of the comments that there are people who were offended simply by the fact that the polish twins use elliptical storytelling tactics and i want to say thats one of the things that makes this film so great its willingness to embrace the mysterious as an aspect of everyday life david mullens cinematography is stunning highly recommended if youve suffered a meaningful personal loss such as the death of a parent i would even call this film necessary viewing  ray
