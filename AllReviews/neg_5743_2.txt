NEG this is a relatively watchable movie  after watching ukm ultimate killing machine this one looks good in comparison there are no obvious technical gaffes although the vampiric teeth look oddbr br the story line makes no sense lets see an american gi fights vampires comes back to the states and is rehabilitated for seeing vampires his commanding officer is the aunt of his exwife who happens to be doing some research on the biodiversity of the south american area where the vampires are huh dont pile on too many coincidences who cares about the head vampire or his daughter or any one in this film the only originality in this is that most of the myths about vampires allergic to crosses and garlic cant come out in the day etc are wrong but they cant be killed except by beheading or a wood wound in the heart yeah right its obvious they just didnt want to film a dark movie since this is a made for tv filmbr br it would have been nice for the viewer if they had hired some actors oh theyve got lynda carter tvs wonder woman and a big black dude with a tremendously deep voice who snarls appropriately in order to show off his vampire teeth prosthetics but otherwise you would never know they had actually paid people to read these linesbr br there is more than enough fight scenes and some vampirebitingneck blood but no real violence
