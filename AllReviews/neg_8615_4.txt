NEG i watched this movie tonight and i do need to say that it is horrible i expected it to be great because you know usually we dont have many movies about asian vampires mixed with asian culture but already in the beginning it started in a bad way the introduction of the movie seemed not to have an end the plot is so weak and if you take the fights and the soundtrack off you really dont have anything useful at all the director of this film doesnt look to have some important notions about how much time to spend in introduction and flashbacks for example not to mention some other thingsbr br for people like me who wants to watch a great vampire movie i really recommend to watch lost boys or the interview with the vampire
