NEG travolta and thurman deserved a better movie this one is very secondary in all aspects not a single fresh idea but the biggest problem is this films ridiculous philosophy a gang of black rappers after all their criminal activities and even killing people are becoming almost positive mickey mouselike heroes performing on stage and giving away awards at the ceremony perhaps this matches the real life but showing it as a quite normal happyending is beyond my imagination whats wrong with shooting a couple of bad ukrainians if they are not politically correct  the show must go on that makes me think that hollywood writers have a big problem with separating good and evil even if the genre supposed to be a black comedy
