POS this must be the dumbest movie ive ever seen and therefor it deserves a special award ok so it begins pretty good logical humor and then rapidly changes to complete and utter uh frtss fck stupidity that makes total sense the strange thing is that i hardly laughed at it though i guess it is supposed to be funny with a very serious message after a moment of thought why i didnt laugh the answer was pretty clear this movie is a lot more realistic then i would like it to be so it is extremely dumb yet very wise if the object was to reach people which arent blessed with a whole lot of neurons and synapses and electrolytes huh electrolytes this movie might actually be understood at some level by a big audiencebr br although they probably just laughbr br ah well nice trybr br i am now editing well adding to my comment cause i read some of the other comments first i noticed some people see racism in this movie well that did not at all cross my mind when watching it however i can imagine if you are looking from that perspective you will see some we could of course debate the link between intelligence and race but i think this is not the place to do so i wonder if we were to rate the huxtable family here would you complain about them all being black i dont think so but i guess you could aside from that from the  wisest people in the world half the woman doesnt seem totally caucasian to me so what the problem isbr br secondly the movie gets very mixed ratings from s to s and everything in between but a lot of polarisation there which means the movie does its job very well it stirrs people up makes them want to speak about it and judge it that means it is a good movie whether you like it or hate it after  minutes it becomes very predictive and boring even yet you keep watching this utter crap i guess you keep hoping that it isnt so or maybe its our sick way to look at terrible accidents well this is one for sure
