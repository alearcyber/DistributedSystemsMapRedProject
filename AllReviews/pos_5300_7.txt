POS hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories br br the story revolves around the friendship between a magical sea spritegoldfish and the human child that she encounters during a curious outing to see the human world the human child sosuke doi hiroki lives in a small house on a cliff overlooking a small port city in southern japan based on seto island where he lives with his young mom lisa yamaguchi tomoko sosuke names the strange goldfish ponyo and takes it to the daycarenursing center that lisa works at ponyo is definitely not your typical goldfish and soon begins to adapt and take on human aspects she develops human speech and an appetite for ham meat by sampling some blood from a cut on sosukes finger br br yet just as sosuke and ponyo begin to develop a bond ponyo is taken back by her father fujimoto tokoro joji who is a former human who has rejected the surface world and is now attempting to collect and develop magical elixirs taken from the sea that aid him in repairing and rejuvenating the worlds oceansbr br ponyos desire to become human has become so strong however that fujimoto is unable to contain her anymore and she takes on a more human appearance and breaks free from her water world home and goes back to see sosuke br br during her breakout ponyo unintentionally releases fujimotos cache of magical elixirs which unleashes all sorts of magical sea creatures that causes a violent storm in the seas surrounding sosukes town desperate to resolve ponyos rebellion he soon calls upon the help of his beautiful wife ponyos mother  the water elemental motherlady of the sea amami yuki br br as with his past films miyazakis gake no ue no ponyo touches upon various themes of ecology and environmentalism this time focusing on the health and vitality of the worlds oceans the opening sequence is at times sobering when ponyo encounters a drudging vessel which is scraping the oceans floor uncovering mountains of garbage and debris one can understand the anger and frustration of the character of fujimoto who has spent his lifetime trying to repair the damage civilization is doing to its oceans yet finding it an daunting and almost fruitless endeavorbr br enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film it is at times bizarre and outrageous but at the same time charming and curious clearly miyazaki wanted to capture the sense and style of a childs imagination the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful it is almost like a childs color book come to lifebr br child actors nara yuria and doi hiroki do great work as ponyo and sosuke they bring adorable charm to their roles nara yuria in particular sounds so darn cute as ponyo that it is little wonder that dois sosuke falls for the magical girl former campaign girlmodel and actress yamaguchi tomoko shichinin no otaku swallowtail is also very good in her role as sosukes modern mom lisa i was a bit confused at first by her character as i initially thought she was sosukes older sister it also didnt help that sosuke kept referring to her as lisa rather than mom but i guess it is perhaps a sign of the times and an indicator of the modern japanese family in the anime series crayon shinchan shinnosuke also refers to his mom by first name as wellbr br s comedian tokoro joji sounds totally different as the serious fujimoto but wisely doesnt make his character sound cartoony villainous or goofy menacing while we dont get to know his character more former probaseball player and actor nagashima kazushige  who portrays sosukes father koichi also delivers some nice voice work the opening theme umi no okasan by japanese soprano masako hayashi is simply beautiful and stirring in contrast the fujimaki fujioka and nozomi ohashi geke no ue no ponyo theme is light and amusing and evokes images of a traditional japanese nursery rhyme during one brilliant sequence the soundtrack takes on an almost wagnerian operatic sound with music that sounds like die walkrebr br the film is not perfect however and does suffer from moments where the central story of ponyo and sosuke takes a back seat to some of miyazakis overwhelming fantastical visuals i also had wished we had more time to explore fujimotos backstory as well as the relationship between sosuke and his fatherbr br like kikis delivery servicemajo no takkyubin howls moving castle princess momonokemomonoke hime and my neighbor totorotonari no totoro gake no ue no ponyo is another miyazaki classic that is a marvelous feast for the eyes like a modern day fairytale the film tells a timeless story of friendship and love that will surely be cherished in years to come
