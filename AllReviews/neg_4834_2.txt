NEG i happened to catch this on tv and wanted to watch because i remembered the spin magazine article upon which the movie is based i was very disappointed first if james belushi is the lead actor in a movie it should be a sign that its not exactly an alist production gregory hines was a world class dancer but sadly not a great actorbr br in fact all of the acting in this film is either flat or hammy which can only be blamed on the director who is this films weakest link charles carner seemed to be trying to ape oliver stones jfk in portraying the alleged conspiracy to cover up the real child murderers but without the benefit of a good script an alist cast or it must be said the talent it just doesnt workbr br its a shame that such a worthy topic for a film did not get better treatment
