NEG for awhile i was hooked on shows like ghost hunters and destination truth and stuff even though i thought they were full of crap i found them interesting and entertaining and thats why we watch entertainment tv its fun to turn off your brain and believe that every shadow caught on camera is not just some shadow but some insane asylum inmates tormented spirit or something so long as you can snap back to the real world laterbr br that being said enjoying paranormal state requires more than merely shutting your brain off it requires you to consume lead in large doses on a regular basis during your childhood then suffer repeated head trauma then take up huffing paint in your teens then you have to get highdrunk and watchbr br paranormal state is beyond the pseudoscience which i can enjoy with a degree of critical thinking that youll find on ghost hunters which i still find to be reasonably interesting and entertaining program its pseudo everythingbr br the show follows the adventures of a group of students from penn state university not to be confused with university of pennsylvania lead by ryan buell as they take it upon themselves to exorcise demons and spirits using ceremonies from whatever religion seems most dramatic at the time ranging from catholic exorcisms performed by college coeds to wiccan spells cast by socially awkward goths to native american cleansing rituals to their credit these are performed by native americans if you believe in wicca or youre catholic or a follower of a traditional native american religions i think youd want their cleansing rituals performed by someone who isnt a maladjusted college student with some free time i dont remember the scene in the exorcist where the priests threw up their hands and said its no use call up an after school club from the state college this one is too much for us theyve probably read the wikipedia article on exorcisms the show is frankly insulting to the intelligence to the viewer the shows opening title sequence has ryan talking about prs the paranormal research society saying that when he came to penn state notice you dont see any shows where the host says the same thing but instead of penn state he says when i came to mit or after i got my theoretical physics degree he found other people with similar interest in the paranormal he says they are sometimes warriors i remember when i used to pretend i was a warrior and i fought ghosts i was six then the emotionless ryan brings out the flamboyant and obnoxious chip coffey who pretends to go into trances and become possessed by cussing at the cast awesome i thought people had learned some sense about how ridiculous the idea of psychics and mediums is after crossing over went off the air the show takes itself way too seriously as this small group of societal misfits pretends they are battling against some ancient cosmic evil production values are low stories are boring and unlike ghost hunters which will occasionally catch something anomalous although likely explainable but interesting nonetheless on their equipment ps requires you to believe that the noises and creaks that they hear are evidence of demons ghouls and possibly leprechauns the only thing scary about this show is that there are people out there that take it seriously the only thing paranormal about it is that the people on it are able to make each episode while keeping a straight facebr br call me jaded but i feel like the great mysteries of the universe and the afterlife are too great to be solved in a halfhour tv show by a journalism undergrad at a state schoolbr br all that being said i highly recommend that everyone watch this show at least once if for no other reason than the sheer entertainment derived from watching a truly terrible movie or tv show or you can make a drinking game out of it i think the second would be preferable
