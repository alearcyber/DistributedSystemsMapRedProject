NEG this is the worst movie ive ever seen boring illogical terrible dont waste even a minute in your life to watch this crap i hope the directors wont make any other movie because this movie bankrupts them the movie seems to be created in one or two days with some friends of the directors if we can use this word for these  guys they use only camera in hand many scenes are in darkness and nothing can be seen lots of scenes  of the movie are with conversation only  there are movies like vampire vs zombies which you can laugh on but this one is simply bad no point to making such movies please stop jason horton and shannon hubbel dont make more movies
