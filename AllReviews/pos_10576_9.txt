POS im usually disappointed by what the media dubs lesbian movies these days murderous bisexuals psychotic murderous lesbians women who experiment with other women but end up with men at the end ridiculously goodlooking women who only get w each other to turn men on etcbr br thankfully fingersmith is on a very high pedestal above this garbage it is a credible love story acted marvelously by every cast member down to the least of the supporting actors aside from having a very engaging central conflict the romance between the heroines is well developed and believable thanks to cassidy and hawkinsbr br i have also seen tipping the velvet but fingersmith is far superior to the former both in characterconflict development and the quality of the actingbr br fingersmith is both satisfying and enjoyable to watch offering lesbians everywhere a great followup act to bound
