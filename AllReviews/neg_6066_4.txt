NEG am i the only person who saw and remembers amadeus every scene in copying has its counterpart in the milos forman amadeus  from the galloping carriages accompanied by frenzied strings to the entrance of anna through the dark hallway preceded by the man with the key to the very dialog of the conclusion with anna at beethovens feet a la salieri before the dying mozart does no one else recall the dialog in that script br br salieri time  mozart common time we begin with the strings and so it copiesbr br remember cynthia nixon leaning against a door jamb tears falling down her freckled face  same scene just replace her with beethovens nephew even the scatological humor fart jokes are the same we even have a cardinal followed around by a plate of sweet cookies which recalls salieri in the banquet hall does no one else remember br br and the scene where anna cries to god why did you give me this gift salieri said the same thingbr br and beyond all that we have a juvenile script with an opening exposition that reads like the character identifications youd find in a childrens story i am mr beethoven i am the composerbr br and what after all is the purpose of the bridge builder other than to juxtapose the technical against the artistic a comparison that is not at all developed  probably because it has no meaning especially when it comes to beethove who was a master of the technicalbr br theres only one great scene  the playing of the ninth first the music which of itself takes you to tears but then there is the highly erotic interaction of anna the copyist keeping time and beethoven conducting which surpasses the most explicit sexual intimacy so intense its almost embarrassingbr br but please  the rest of the film  where is the worlds collective memory you have seen this all before  and better
