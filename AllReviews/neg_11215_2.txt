NEG i have seen cheesy kung fu fight films living in taiwan they come on in lieu of sitcoms in america i have seen movies make fun of themselves but this film belongs in the sad category of fight films that try too hard with awful actors awful props and awful music to be taken seriously i seriously felt pity for the person who composed the music for this movie how sad it must be to be a composer who has to churn out crap like what i thought should have been titled generic ninja fight scene op  or variations on a bad guy pointing a gun at a girls head when backed into a corner or the daring flight of the helicopter then the fight scenes were over and the credits rolled those actually had me in tears laughing if the special effects werent proof enough that this was lowbudget the fact that only two or three of the crew members presumably locals which although good for the muchneeded phillipino economy was probably done solely to save money have ever done anything since this series of movies they rented equipment despite making sequels to this movie that was pretty funny too the thing that really had me going though was not the music which left me half expecting an animated sargeant slaughter from gi joe to pop up but the endingi suppose this would be a spoiler if there was really a plot to spoil but when the american ninja drops the girl into jacksons arms and then takes off his mask i wanted to see him jump off the roof and jackson drop the girl to catch himbr br i think that would have been the perfect punchline for this joke of a movie
