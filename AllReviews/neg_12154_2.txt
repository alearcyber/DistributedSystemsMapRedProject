NEG im really amazed that this got an  on rotten tomatoes and a nomination for best foreign film at the oscars the  rating on imdb thats not so much of a surprise seeing the way imdb users have been voting recently i just cant get into a film in which the actual facts about its main character have clearly been distorted and not at all in a way to make the movie artistic but rather to make it melodramatic and less boring which it turns out actually makes it very boring for anyone who was expecting to see a serious and credible interpretation of the life of genghis khan the farfetched and overdramatized mongol often echoes the likes of  a film that couldnt be happier to be ridiculously inaccurate but unlike  mongol takes itself seriously its stoic seriousness mixed with the obvious inaccuracies is what makes it truly the most boring film ive seen this year possibly the most action or biopic movie ive ever seen the characters were pathetically written honestly i doubt genghis khan was as boring and passive as shown in this film which is funny to me because if theres anything that id think should be changed for the sake of theatricality its making a boring person into an interesting person the romance between khan and borte is similarly boring simple and stupid also without giving anything away mongol contains the single stupidest scene i have seen in a long time where there should be a good  minutes of plot development the film just skips forward without any explanation it looked like something out of a saturday night live skit that parodies epic action movies with horrible pacing did i mention how seriously mongol takes itself meanwhile it drags like no film ive ever seen before even now i could swear it was three hours long about  minutes into it i checked the time being pretty certain that it was almost finished besides some pretty scenery and quality acting from asano naturally mongol is honestly just a disaster it completely failed to entertain me or enlighten me in anyway i would never give this film a second chance and not to sound racist or patriotic or whatever but give me a trashy and mindless american epic over mongol any day at least then i know what im getting unlike with mongol where the reviews and ratings led me to believe it was actually something worth seeingbr br the saddest thing about how much i hated mongol is that i have friends who i know without a doubt would simply love it
