POS my partner and i had never heard of this movie and decided to give it a shot picking the title from a list of movies on cable without knowing a single thing about it as it opened and revealed the cast we thought well how bad can it be  kathy bates jonathan pryce rupert everett lynn redgrave dan akroyd and more as the story unfolded we became more and more tickled with our selection and the film soon had us laughing out loud throughout this is not a great film but it is one of those rare films that has such a great combination of memorable characters taken through truth is stranger than fiction type surreal events that i couldnt help but love it i had no problem suspending my disbelief at some of the wackier story elements because the intentions of the filmmakers are so warmhearted while they still manage to poke fun at everyone involved as others on imdb said this is a comfort movie and i too wouldnt be surprised if it became a cult classic
