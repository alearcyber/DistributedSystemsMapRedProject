NEG spoilers ahead jeeeeeeeesussssssssss i have a saying insecticides kill insects and moronicides kill morons the ghost in this movie kills morons several of the people who get killed in this movie are actually asking to get killed by running into abandoned houses going after ghosts etcbr br on a strictly cinematic aspect this movie sucks real bad the three story lines are shown to be parallel and suddenly we learn they are separated by at least a few days its a cheap shotbr br also the thrills are so cheap they are laughable even nightmare on elm street didnt sink so low as to show someone being attacked by his own sweater its patheticbr br save your money stay home and you wont have a grudge against the filmmakers
