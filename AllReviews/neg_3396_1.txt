NEG this is my opinion of this movie expressed in its dialogsbr br to be more serious i cant say this movie is a bad moment but i didnt enjoy it either br br first i was simply indifferent  couldnt get my mind into the apes world even though the makeup are very realistic the constant screaming was irritating may the film have changed apes for cats and its a cult movie for me in relation to my fondness of the latterbr br the second part is more interesting with the talent and freshness of then newcomers macdowell  lambert but i felt alienated all the story is located in a big british mansion no matter how luxurious is it it was like a prison for mebr br at last it could be a good adaptation of the burroughs story of tarzan  i dont know having never read the book or seen the disney br br in conclusion i dont have any good moments to remember so one viewing would be enough for me br br i should have guessed my boredom after the endless freeze called overture at the beginning whats the meaning only the director knows it
