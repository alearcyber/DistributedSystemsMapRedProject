NEG there seems to be a spectrum of cinema on the left there are movies made mostly for entertainment andor commercial purposes in the middle there are movies that are both entertaining and artistic on the right are movies that are not as commercial but are focused more on cinema as art than cinema as productbr br im not here to say any one part of the spectrum is better than any other but that when a movie goes too far to either end its rarely good such is the case with naqoyqatsibr br i had no idea what to expect when i saw it advertised a few friends were going and asked if i wanted to come along none of us knew what to expect and by the end none of us were pleasedbr br yes there are breathtaking images yes im amazed at the lengths the filmmakers went to in searching through archival footage yes the soundtrack is enjoyable to listen to and probably the best part of the experience the thing is this goes so far to the right side of the spectrum i mentioned that i cant say anything nice about the movie as a wholebr br its preachy its a jumble of symbolism and obvious morality its not saying anything new or forcing the viewer to examine life in a new way its just telling us things we already know that is if we can even figure out what its sayingbr br this movie is simply art for arts sake an attempt to say look at how deep and thoughtprovoking we can be by using montage when a film becomes more about how clever or intelligent its creators are than about its subject it ceases to be a film and simply becomes celluloid selfgratification
