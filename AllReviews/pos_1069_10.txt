POS i first saw this film about  years ago and i have been enchanted by it ever since it is such a feelgood experience that i could happily watch it at any time of the year however to me it is the ultimate christmas moviebr br the fact that it is in bw is irrelevant  although i often wonder what it would be like in colour you can just get that warm glowing feeling watching the christmas events unfold br br stanwyck and morgan are perfect together and greenstreet is the antithesis of his usual character sakall is a blustering joy to watchbr br it is light relief and certainly does not tax the brain but leaves you feeling glad that you saw itbr br i cant wait for it to become available on dvd in the uk i shall certainly be at the front of the queue to buy it
