NEG this is absolutely the worst comedy i have ever seen its hard to explain though because unless youve seen this i bet youve never seen a comedy that was not good or bad its just there thats the original partnot good or bad just there br br let me say that i have seen every comedian appearing in a main role and like them all thats what makes this such a mystery the supporting leads are actually acting although the dialog is bad the only character that is fairly good is the one played by john goodman he does a pretty good job with what little dialog he has and actually has one funny line i wont spoil the only funny line in the movie in case you decide to watch anyway it involves a pancake the big mysteries are the main leads i wont call them characters because no characters have been developed this script is so juvenile that they dont even bother to give the leads fictional names they all just use their own they dont even seem to be trying to act its as though they are all reading out loud to each other from scripts that the local junior high sent to them i actually wrote a paper like this for my english class when i was thirteenit wasnt funny eitherbr br bottom line just dont bother to rent this it isnt funny it doesnt even have the kind of bad dialog you can groan to i just sat there and stared through the whole thing it was so boring i couldnt even work up any irritation at how bad it was i cant imagine how this is even getting a rating of  here
