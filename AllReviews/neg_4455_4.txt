NEG its a shame that such a lame plot should be hung on such picturesque locations with some documentary style reportage shoved in for extra length a shorter film may have held the tension a little more and a more charismatic lead may not have mangled his lines so much the female lead also was not allowed to do enough resulting in a pretty but boring affair it builds towards the end but the lead actors own redemption is too little too late and should have been revealed earlier in the film not awful just a pity unexciting but nice enough to grace tv schedules of the early hours
