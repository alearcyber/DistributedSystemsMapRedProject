NEG watched this months ago on netflix instant and left a review therebr br let me say most of the other reviews are very accurate this movie was bad writing bad acting and bad directing i too had liked russell and pare back in the old days and was very hopeful for them in my netflix review i mentioned that i lost interest in the film and proceeded to wash the dishes and make a sandwich yet still watching the movie from the kitchen when i did return to the living room i was very confused as the last  minutes of the film unfolded i even rewound it to make sure i was not missing anything this film totally crapped out on how to do a twist ending i suspect that the idea sounded good maybe the script was intriguing but the budget was so nonexistent that sets were really lacking and yes i suppose all those bad sets were an effort to give the viewer a clue all it told me was low budgetbr br anyway the reason i came here was because over the weekend i saw a review of shutter island and with what the reviewers were saying or not saying lead me to believe that shutter island is the same deal only with a budget  to  times more actually i have no idea how much dark world cost but i hope they didnt spend more than  millionbr br so that being said i kinda thought that if someone reworked the script a bit got a bigger budget for a better look whether that meant a better scenic designer or better post coloring just someone with a vision they could remake dark world into a passable product now it sounds like shutter island is doing that looks like they got the vision right but the scripting could still be off money cant buy everything but it should in hollywoodbr br ps my  star rating is for russell and pare
