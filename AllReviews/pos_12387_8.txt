POS i suppose this movie is not your typical spanish thriller as it is based in a real story that took place abroad the movie is based in the real story of french man jeanclaude romand and the real case is much more gory and scary than the film in the real story of mr romand the family didnt escape after years of lies he decided to end it all by killing his wife two children parents and dog and although he tried to kill himself it seems he didnt try very hard as he survived i watched the movie with people next to me talking about how it could never happen in real life that all these lies went undetected i was laughing as i had read the book about mr romand and knew it did happen i like jos coronado in this movie he offered us a good performance as the rest of the crew
