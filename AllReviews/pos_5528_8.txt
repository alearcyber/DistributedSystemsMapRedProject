POS i watched six of a kind for wc fields  hes only in it for around  minutes and has one long scene the infamous pool sequence he made famous in vaudeville and several other great moments the reamaining  minutes are also delightful thankfully mostly due to the hilarious charlie ruggles as the bumbling banker j pinkham whinney he is everyones foil he stutters and stumbles about to our pleasure also his comedy partner mary boland plays his wife flora joining in the proceedings are george burns and gracie allen boland is particularly funny near the beginning and near the end but gracie and ruggles use up most of the picture gracies funny quite but she can also get tiring and poor george burns has absolutely nothing to do except repeat gracie all the time i dont remember laughing at him once although he has one great scene with ruggles where ruggles tries desperately to get george to take gracie and leave him and his wife alone for a while and one with fields where he asks fields to sell him a sweater that bit is exclusively fields though the situation is constantly funny the whinneys are going to drive to california but to help them with expenses george and gracie are recruited
