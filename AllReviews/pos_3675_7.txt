POS this is one of the oddest movies i have watched in a long while usually if they are this strange i bail out early and rarely regret it luckily i held on for this one while i cant say that this is a great movie it isnt i can say that watching it is rather like a good acid trip  only a few really awful moments and the rest filled with did i really just see that wonderment lots of laugh out loud moments a great cast of characters with meredith eaton outstanding as the dwarf daughterinlaw with an attitude keep an open mind
