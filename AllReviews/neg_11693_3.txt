NEG im a fan of the horror movie regardless of which hemisphere it comes from i know what to expect from the west the east and most horrors in the middle so i received the dvd of acacia in the post and looked forward to a slow build of ever increasing tension and scary children with odd disjointed movements hiding under duvetsbr br the major selling point for this film was that it has a far more linear story line than many of this ilk  you get who the characters are where they are from and what they do you get the baseline information nice couple cant have children and realise that the premise is just too normal for something freaky not to happenbr br and then comes the bad the number one complaint is that the story is obvious i got it pretty much the moment the kid hugged the tree i knew where the film was going and was even able to predict the order of death and for what reasonbr br the editing is shocking and unfortunately not to the benefit of the film even were i still pondering the events tension isnt allowed to build because the director seems to have gotten a new editing suite for his birthday and wanted to use it as much as possiblebr br and my final gripe is thisthe tree was unnecessary this would have been a perfectly good tale of subtle horror with just the couple breaking down over the death of the child  the titular tree bought nothing new or exciting to the film so ill finish where i started  my overall impression was oh
