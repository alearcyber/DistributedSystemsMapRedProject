POS saw this film at the nft in london where it was showing as part of the bfis john huston season i wasnt really sure what to expect and the first few minutes of the film gave very little away in fact the rest of the film continued to give little away no real plot no action no suspense very little drama and except for a short section at the very end no scenerybr br the result of lack of all of these features was however a wonderful film i dont fully understand why but i think that its understated nature made the film almost completely perfect the acting script and most important of all the casting were all spot on and i cant remember walking away from a cinema feeling so good but i still cant work out why i just know that i will be getting the dvd this is one of those films that will i am sure be just as good on the small screen as the cinema experience provided that you can find somewhere quiet to watch it and i will be watching it again soon i will be also interested to find out what my family and friends think of it im sure that it will not be everybodys choice but i am convinced that a large number will agree with my viewbr br  out of
