NEG while not truly terrible this movie is still largely a waste of time and paints an incredibly inaccurate and revisionist picture of beach boys historybr br basically this movie would have you believe that mike love was the brains behind the band and brian wilson was just a pathetic psycho in fact none of the characters is developed beyond a onedimensional parody but this is a tv movie so what do you expect mike loves foul stench is all over this turkey as he attempts to rewrite history with himself in the role of band figurehead and resident genius yeah as ifbr br on the plus side the music is excellent unlike the previous beach boys madefortv biopic summer dreams this movie actually features real beach boys music rather than anemic cover versionsalso it features a surprising number of beach boysrelated rarities and seldomheard tracks  the sunrays i live for the sun being but one examplebr br this movie was originally shown in two parts on american network tv part one is the superior of the two and documents the boys early days and rise to the top by the time part two rolls around the brian wilson character has become a mere cartoon and the actor seems to be playing for laughs  but how could anyone take this crap seriously if youre not a beach boys fan you probably wont get much out of this movie except an extremely warped and onesided view of the bands history but then again why would you watch this if you werent a fan
