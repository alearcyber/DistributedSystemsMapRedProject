NEG if youre like me and you occasionally enjoy watching terrible movies i guess its kind of like slowing down at a car crash you cant do better than this the plot is inane the special effects are hilarious and the acting is some of the worst youll ever see  thumbs down wooohoooooooo seriously i have no idea how the director and the actors can sleep at night its painful and yet hysterically funny to watch and i highly recommend it for those who want to punish themselves for something if you can watch this crap without wincing youre a better man than ill ever be i wonder if the producer of this garbage had any idea what he was getting himself and his money into
