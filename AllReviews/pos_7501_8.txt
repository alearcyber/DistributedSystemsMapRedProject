POS this movie has some of the best dialogue ever written the really good lines are all given to george c scott a man who knew what to do with a juicy piece of dialogue i just saw this movie again for the first time in  years and the dialogue is as good as ever the bizarre goingson at the hospital are so imaginative as to dazzle you they frequently involve such marvelous poetic justice as to be near strokes of genius i love this movie
