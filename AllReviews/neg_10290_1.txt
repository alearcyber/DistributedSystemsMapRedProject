NEG i am not sure who recommended surveillance to me but i think i have an idea one of the fat guys at the movies the person said they were astonished by how great it was and said it was one of the goriestdisturbing movies im paraphrasing and doing this only by memory so forgive me if i misquoted at any rate i made the decision to watch it so i take full blame for my own miscalculation in watching one of the most horrible predictable and stupid movies ive ever seen strange i doubt ive ever called a movie stupid but that was the first word that came to mind about onethird in and stayed in my mind until the endbr br where to begin unbelievable premise and reactions incredibly braindead characters could blame the writing or the actors or ill just blame both and enormously bad acting id sooner believe bill pullman as president of the usa than a fbi agent here of course theres a reason for that and ill partially go into that and to top it off if you cant figure the socalled shocking twist in the first  minutes then you must have arrived late to the theatre or came into the room to watch it late dont worry theyll tell you the twist every five minutes thereafterbr br theres been some serial killers on the loose in the most depressing town in the county or world but theres more to the story some dumbass and corrupt cops like to blow out tires for their own amusement could there possibly be more oh yeah theres a family well maybe not but there are four humans one boy one girl and an adult couple the girl says she sees things with much less conviction than cole sees dead people in the sixth sense theres gotta be more to this than what i mentioned thats what makes a movie interesting adding as many subplots that maymay not be developed is the way to go okay then ill continue we have goofy fbi agents that made me laugh a pair of giggling druggies whos shocked at first their dealer ods but then resorts to robbery a goshtooting greatguy cop who mustve been put in for comic relief whos always battling an angrysuspicious cop and finally poor poor michael ironside who didnt just phone his performance in he barely text it inbr br none of these work theyre all told in various forms of presence tense or flashbacks and believe me youll lose all sense of caring after the first of many subplots begin in addition the reaction some of these characters are the most shocking of all i guess im referring mostly to the cops but mainly the girl who did or did not just lose her family and barely blinksbr br this stupid stupid movie stinks its barely gory as the person that recommended it said it was unless his exposure has been limited to goosebumps stories and whats with the title surveillance oh i get it its because it was used in  subplots just to film interviews since thats so random it might as well been called cop car bullet or coffee just stay away from this horrid mess
