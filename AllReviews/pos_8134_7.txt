POS this was laurel and hardys last silent film for roach studios however since the public had a real thirst for talkies this same short was remade by the team just a few years later with only a few small plot changes laughing gravy was essentially the same plot except that stan and ollie were trying to hide a cute puppy from their grouchy landlordnot a goat like in angora love this whole goat angle is the worst part of the film while you could understand the boys wanting to keep a cute little dog after all it is snowy outside why exactly they bring a goat home is just contrived and pointless according to the plot the goat followed them home and so they got tired of shooing it away and kept it huh this just doesnt make any senseif it had been a giraffe or a cow would they have done the same thing apart from being an unconvincing plot the movie itself is pure laurel and hardy with a familiar plot and familiar roles for the comedians this film features quite a few laughs but unfortunately isnt one of their better films to wrap up their silent careers this aspect of their careers just seems to have ended with a whimper
