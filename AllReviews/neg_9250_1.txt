NEG so bad as good  not only the script is obvious but the acting is not just poor but pathetic the worst of all is the definition of the characters unrealistic ingenuity affected reactions camera forcing to watch superficial aspects which are introduced as keys to the plotbr br cant prevent laughing when at the end main character says to second something like your daughter plays no soccer and knows no cooking such offense to female intelligence defines the level of this filmbr br is the film about the psychological behaviour of the second character about its impact on the main character or just a sequence of events set in order to heat for the obvious ending br br pls make more of these  i had a good time guessing what next would go wrong
