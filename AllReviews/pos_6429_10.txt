POS when oh when will someone like anchor bay or blue underground release this on widescreen dvd le orme which i only know because of my rarevintage video collecting habit is a film in my collection that i would not only sit through but actually enjoy watching the fact that klaus kinski is top billed but is only in small parts of the film means little to me though several comments expressed disappointment in his rather limited screen time i cannot say that this is a good horror film a good mystery a scifi epic or anything of that nature it is simply unclassifiable in the genre sense of things it is more like a confusing frightening though not particularly violent or bloody dream filled with great visuals and mystery it relies on visuals and emotion much like bavas lisa and the devil both films are beautiful in almost every sense but almost impossible to describe in a logical manner they both occur in such a dreamlike atmosphere dont be deterred by force videos synopsis on the back cover it is infinitely more complex and intriguing than that though force videos release from  the only one in the us that i know of is cropped to fullscreen on tape even in that format it is still great releasing it remastered andor letterboxed would make it magnificent hint hint dvd companies
