POS if you are looking for a modern film version of buster crabbe or johnny weismullers overcoming the machinations of unscrupulous white safari guides or cunning black tribesmen while saving the animal kingdom this is not the movie for you this is a recounting of the tarzan legend from its beginning in intelligent adult terms it is beautifully filmed and faithful to the edgar rice burroughs storiesbr br tarzan is no action hero but a man torn between two worlds  the natural and the civilized in a stunning performance christopher lambert portrays this angst with absolute realism if he slips up just once the cat will be out of the bag the audience especially the adult audience targeted by the film will laugh and the film will completely lose its grip it will plummet into the cheesy depths but lambert never lets that happen forget what you may think of him in other movies when i saw this film at the theater on its original release i thought he deserved an academy awardbr br the supporting cast is uniformly excellent as other commentators have noted i disagree with most of them in that i didnt find anything wrong with andie mcdowells performance i wouldnt have nominated her for an academy award  the role is undemanding  but she is completely up to it such as it is i dont know why her voice was overdubbed eitherbr br the cinematography of the african segment of the tale is absolutely beautiful it captures both the beauty of the african wilderness and the exotic expectation it holds in the collective imagination of those who have never been there the scenery is lush and exotic and the colors are vividbr br but this is also a period film and the cinematography also magnificently depicts victorian england  the countryside the city and the interiors the costumes are outstanding the soundtrack is beautiful without being overwhelming or obtrusivebr br there are some disturbing scenes  especially for animal lovers  but no more disturbing than a few scenes in dances with wolves this is an excellent film about the conflict between civilization and nature personified in the young lord greystoke convincingly portrayed by christopher lambert
