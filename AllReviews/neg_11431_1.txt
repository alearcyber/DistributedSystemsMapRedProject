NEG with a humor that would appeal to an exclusive small audience the average viewer will find it pointless and monotonous when cartoon network advertised this show it was made to look as if it was a major drama or event complete with a real rain scene and government officials trying to catch the sheepbr br when it came out on the air i was disappointed at how all the characters were so onedimensional and a totally bland animation the only thing that put it to anything close to humor were the names of the characters like private public and general specific a few vague references to cultural aspects and how lady richington pummeled sheep with her steel wigbr br slightly off topic but i dont see why would sheep fall in love with that ball of dirty cotton balls called swanky it was hideous
