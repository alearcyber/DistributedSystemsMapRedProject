POS after the atomic bomb hits hiroshima charred bodies lie all around deformed victims attempt to communicate with relatives who cant even recognize them and one person after another dies of radiation sickness this black and white film however sad and scary is not without humor the story revolves around a young woman yasuko who was hit by black rain after the explosion she is trying to get married but everyone keeps dying and people are worried the same will happen to her after finding a suitable mate who is losing his mind after being in the war for too long she ends up showing signs of radiation sickness this film is a great portrayal of the atomic attacks on japan it will frighten you and will perhaps make you cry the acting is good not overly dramatic like many other ww films that have been made
