NEG i unwittingly walked into this trap of a moviebr br if i could turn back time or simply get a refund i would be happybr br it was pm and cinderella man didnt start until pm so i rushed into the theater to catch the movie that started at pmand i dare say god reached out his hand or retracted it and allowed me to punish myself for my film gluttony by sitting in for this filmbr br it may be unfair to criticize a movie that was not targeted at my heterosexual male cohort however there is no excuse for lousy sound and video editing this movie was at most worthy of a highschool project budgetand i think ive seen better in those play acting french shorts that we used to do about louis laloupebr br maybe its because im canadian and this film was for the la fudgepacking crew and their sympathizing dames woe was me when i realized that then entire audience save me cracked up at all the jokes and entendresi fully understood the hinted humorbut i just could not relatebr br this show did show me supposedly how gay men date and build relationships however even if it was their purpose of the movie i feel that the gayness was focused on too heavilythe humanity seemed lackingbut again maybe that was the pointsimply to be avantgardand to make a splashbr br i guess with a low budget and poor equipment you have to make your movie as loud as possible in order to get crowds and cash return i really wish i had simply read my sheldon van auken instead hehei was totally the wrong audience
