POS i just saw this film and i recommend it it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything i wont say more because it is better for you have to enter the story as it unfolds
