NEG why why why on earth no one tells the truth about this horrible horrible movie i still wake up in the morning and ask god why he didnt stopped me from seeing this revolting comedy i cant believe i paid to see this offense to my cinematographic taste im starting to think that the  stars it has is because of martha higareda s nudity and all the men who cant buy a porn film and avoid seeing this  i will call it thing cause call it film is an insult to the mexican film industry the characters are a huge clich the acting causes involuntary laugh and the script is well i cant believe a human being wrote this and just when you thought youve been tortured enoughthe last half hour is so painful that i wished to ripped my eyes out the only good thing i can say about this abomination is that it only last  minutes that would feel like centuries but still really avoid the pain
