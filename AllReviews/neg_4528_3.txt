NEG in yet another miserable attempt to make a quick hollywood cashin of one of televisions greatest masterpieces peter segal has created a monster taken out of context if one did not know brooks work before viewing the movie would be a lame big budget film that isnt sure if it wants to be fat joke and stupid comedy or just an ordinary action film with nothing to move on however as a young generation yer who just recently spent two months obsessing over the five seasons of get smart the s tv show this movie pained me from the moment i entered and saw steve carell dumbing down the part the backstories agent  getting plastic surgery and  as an analyst who was formerly morbidly obese shames the complexity of the original duo and paints a flat boring reevaluation of them it seems the screenwriters unable to be truthfully funny in both dialogue and situation fell back on lame setups for don adams famous lines flashbacks to fat camp references to carells part in the office in the interview style camera angles they have and a female chauvinism that falls flat on its facebr br for those who have seen the original the writers of this movie thought theyd include some memories they mention herbie fang now a worthless tiny furry dog that carell covets the shoe phone the cone of silence and his classic red car and the doors and phone that introd the show the classic music is back but now everything is updated generally for the worse cone of silence is now some weird blue telekinetic force field control headquarters are right under a museum that preserves controls past the movie lacks any creative random tech and replaces it with crossbows in swiss army knives lots of the humor in the movie is carrel hurting himself or another character being hurt whether it be carrel spending two minutes shooting himself accidentally with the crossbow or getting punched by security guards or throwing up in airplanes in the original smart would insult a big foe attack him with no success and try to buddy up with him before getting pulverized in this one he attacks without success and gets pummeled it seems the screenwriters didnt understand the humor was established with the dialogue and not the pointless violence its like they took the names from the show and cut out all that made it good in the first placebr br the poster hides carells face beyond that of hathaways the movie likewise shies away from anything that could make it good they intertwine the classic music with the overdramatic action and romantic music in bigbudget films whereas the original fed off a campy feel this one replaces quality with massive doses of cgi explosions and pow sound effects i was really looking forward to this as i finished the original series just two months ago and it ranked in my top five shows of all time however this was a massive disappointment the credits say they collaborated with mel brooks and buck henry but in all the things ive read on the internet they were largely left out of the writing process in conclusion if you want to waste your money on a cashin with little value and no respect to its namesake go for it but be prepared that the ride is not how you remembered itbr br ps i almost forgot the george bush humor they mention nuculor falling asleep at fine art presidents working for their vice pres and appreciating tackles over solving real problems if youre into hearing the same jokes you heard  years ago in big budget movie form chuck your money here
