NEG i must give credit to billy dee for trying to pull this off knowing this was a blaxploitation film i started my dvd with a certain expectation i knew it would be low budget the acting subpar but hoped for a few gems to be sprinkled throughout if there were any diamonds or gems sprinkled within this film they were successfully buried under tons and tons of coal or perhaps overacting as an actor and filmmaker i cringed often when potential poignant moments were ruined with atrocious performances yet i must admit i could not look away i dont know if this was like a car wreck you cant turn your eyes from or some mysterious power in the film that kept me there this film is a good case for an excellent story that was told wrong if walter kronkite were to tell the aristocrats joke it would be a total flop although the joke itself is hilarious let dave chappelle tell it and we are all rolling on the floor laughing this film needed a chapelle now with that said if you have the opportunity to purchase this film for the dollar that i did do it it is well worth the money perhaps i will take another dollar purchase the rights to this film and remake it who knows it might not be any better but it surely cant be any worse
