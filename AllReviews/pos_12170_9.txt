POS these three directors are off to good beginnings the three stories are remarkably welldone for independent productions and capture those traumatic feelings of coming out when you arent really sure its a good idea i laughed at those veiled glances around the dressing room in pool days i smiled at the notion that fans of bette midler judy garland and barbra streisand are assumed to be gay in a friend of dorothyie browsing through the cd music racks and i cringed over the jock in the disco years whose memory of sweet sex was now blurred by liquor it all seemed so real i look forward to more offerings from this trio of directors
