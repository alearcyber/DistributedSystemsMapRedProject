POS improvisation was used to a groundbreaking degree in this film but it only functions as a novelty no greater truth about the situation is got by asking the actors to improvise the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good so thats why the performances in many robert altman films are often really hestitant  because the actors arent really confident saying lines which theyve made up and therefore arent sure are any goodbr br and quite honestly often its not very good often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundingsbr br it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy  but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badlybr br nevertheless a fascinating raw piece of film and commendable  for taking the power over the green light into the streetbr br there are some generally great things in it this joke for examplebr br im a dancer what sort of a dancer like a ballet dancer oh no exoticbr br and the whole party scene its in the following trip to the park and the scene where the boys go looking at statuesbr br  i wouldnt say theyre worth  hours of your time though
