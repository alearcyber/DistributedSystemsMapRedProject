POS this is a perfectly watchable adventurous movie to watch with a great cast and a good story based on true eventsbr br its interesting to note that the story of the movie is based on true events its above all for most part an adventurous story with all of the usual ingredients you would expect from an adventurous movies set in an arabic world so lots of sword fighting good old fashioned honor religion and a rich proud country but the movie is also filled with humor to make the movie a light and pleasant one to watchbr br the constant cutting back and forth between the morocco plot involving sean connery and candice berger and the american plot line involving theodore roosevelt brian keith wasnt the best possible approach in my opinion the two things have totally different paces totally different characters it are just totally different worlds of course both story lines are connected and focuses on the same thing but the contrast between the two worlds is just too big to let it work out it doesnt at all times make the movie feel connected and a bit disjointed the american plot line is most of the time more political while the morrocan plot line is purely adventurous and action filled in the end you could perhaps even wonder what the whole point or roosevelt in this movie was seem that john milius is just a big admirer of him often the american plot line would take away most of the pace out of the far more interesting and more action filled fast paced morrocan plot line after all john milius always has been at his best as an action directorbr br it isnt until halve way through that the movie fully gets on steam the most and largest scaled action of the movie then kicks in especially the large scale end battle does not disappoint i wish the entire movie was like this that way this movie would had also been a better known one no doubtbr br the movie has a great jerry goldsmith musical score that is perhaps way better known than the actual movie itself the movie is also a good looking one with great production design and nice looking action and battle sequences in it appereantly the movie only costs  to make but that is really hard to believe considering the settings and size of the movie i mean john milius his best known movie conan the barbarian cost about  to make but was a far more campy looking one and was less impressive on its scalebr br quite funny to see an arabic speak with a big fat scottish accent but hey its sean connery so you just simply tend to accept this he suits his role well so does candice bergen its always hard for a female character to come across as believable and work out in a movie such as this one but she manages also john huston plays a great role in this moviebr br a perfectly fine watchable moviebr br
