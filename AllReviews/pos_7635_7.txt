POS lossessa also known as the tormented or the sexorcist or the ridiculously titled the eerie midnight horror show is a forgotten exorcist ripoff which contains one of the best horror moments ive ever seen the scene is when the crucifix comes alive this great spooky scene is unforgettable and totally effective great fxs its a shame the rest of the movie doesnt maintain the level of creepiness exemplified during that scenebr br this is one of the most frustrating movies ever imagine the producers deciding to to make an exorcist copy but while making it they actually succeed in creating something truly original a possessed sculpture of crucified man which is shocking when you think about it but then completely forgets their original idea in order to make a boring and uninspired exorcist ripoff had the film continued with the possessed sculpture concept with the characters trying to destroy it etc this film would have rocked but once the girl becomes possessed by the spirit of the sculpture she never tells anyone from where the demon came from she and the script completely forgets the haunted crucifix which is stupidbr br if you like socalled eurocult movies the first  minutes deliver unlike any other eurocult movies but after the scene when the girl has a vision of being crucified and she gets stigmatas the remaining  minutes suck boring it goes nowhere fast as it tries to emulate badly the exorcist so watch the first  minutes of lossessa and enjoy the s fashions the sleaze and the amazing statuecomesalivetoravishthegirl scene but after the first  minutes press stop and eject and might as well go clip your toenails
