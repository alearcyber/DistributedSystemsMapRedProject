NEG to be honest i did never read one of the comics and cannot remember part  and  at all i can compare to the first part werner  beinhart and this one here is really disappointing compared to part as well as compared to most other movies i watched the last weeks the first minutes seam to be just a needless clone of the first movie intro and then it is becoming even worse there are a few good funny scenes but in total it is just another boring secondrate try of german film industry that cannot succeed nearly as usual one good thing the movie is quite short  min the bad thing it only contains story and jokes for  minutes   dont watch it
