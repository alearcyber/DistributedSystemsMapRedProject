POS the second not animated movie about the only people still refusing to surrender to the roman empire is even more hilarious than the first film asterix  obelix contre ceasarbr br where the first movie got all the laughs because all cartooncharacters were so perfectly brought to life without losing their cartoonesque identity this sequel which is a separate story as are all the comicbooks is even better sure all the ingredients that you find in the first movie and in the comicbooks are present again obelix is still dying to taste the magic potion that gives his other tribe members such enormous powers caesar and the rest of the roman empire are still enemy number  but some new refreshing elements have been brought to the stage as wellbr br not only is setting very idyllic biggest part plays of course in egypt but rather than repeating movie number one some extras have been added by making all kinds of references to other movies bruce lee etc this is all not very new but the unexpected combination of the known story from the comicbook with almost the same title as the movie and references to stuff that has got absolutely nothing to do with asterix  obelix really worksbr br in that way the movie builds further on a tradition by comicwriters goscinny and uderzo who didnt hesitate to bring laurel and hardy on the stage and even dedicate an entire story to kirk douglasbr br if all of this doesnt convince you to watch this movie im sure monica bellucci playing cleopatra will
