POS pitch black is a surprisingly good movie i was not a fan of vin diesel before i saw pitch black but after seeing pitch black my respect for vin diesel has gone up he did a great job playing riddick a man wanted for many murders his character is cold and makes many decisions that surprised me like near the end riddick was going to get on the ship and save his own ass leaving everyone behind to die i like this movie and how it deals with human instinct this movie is low budget but this movie goes to show you dont need amazing special effects and lots of money to make a good movie i think all the characters made this movie i give this movie  out of
