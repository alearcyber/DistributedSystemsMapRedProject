NEG im not sure what the point of making this film was it looked as if it was made by some historical society to be shown in your local pistol pete museum at first it appears that it could be the beginning of a mad tv or snl sketch but then the joke is on you when there is no punchline and you realize that someone was taking this seriously the story wasnt bad but the inclusion of the sass members seemed to be a ploy that worked to get me to see the film i swear the trailer listed every character in the film down to dead cowboy  the reason westerns are so fun is the atmosphere and the characters it brings i just had the feeling i was watching civil war reanactors dressed up as cowboys not even worth the digital video it was recorded on
