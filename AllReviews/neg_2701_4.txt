NEG so far i disliked every single jean rollin movie ive seen and that always bothered me because hes an acclaimed eurotrash monument and extremely popular amongst many regular reviewers on this lovely website people whose opinions i always value and usually concur with apparently everybody always appears to pinpoint some sort of gloomy and stylistic filming trademarks in his work that are completely lost on me rollins movies are unimaginably boring they all feature the same basic concept lesbian vampires in various settings the dialogs are incredibly absurd the marvelous gothic setting are always underused and the production values are cheaper than the price of a bus ticket i had actually given up on rollins repertoire already especially after enduring the iron rose until i found out about night of the hunted allegedly this movie doesnt feature any lame lesbian vampires and stands as a bona fide horror movie with gruesome killings and macabre plot twists and the verdict is  yes and no on one hand this is undeniably the most compelling and inventive rollin film i had the pleasure of seeing thus far and also the only one that i watching without dozing off on the other hand it still remains a moronic movie with a nonsensical plot and emotionless sex sequences to compensate for the dullness jean rollin heavily attempts to generate an atmosphere of secrecy and suspense mostly through a lack of information and vaguely introduced characters but barely manages to hide the fact he actually hasnt got a story to tell at all the unearthly beautiful lead actress brigitte lahaie and the beautifully ominous musical guidance are the only elements that keep you hooked on the screen during a nightly drive back home to paris a young man abruptly has to stop for a confused and scarcely dressed girl who comes running from the woods her name is elisabeth but furthermore she cant remember anything about herself and from what or whom she was running away her case of amnesia is so bad she even continuously forgets who picked her up the next day shes kidnapped again by an old guy and taken to a sinister apartment complex where multiple people in the same bizarre mental state are held captive elisabeth knows nothing but she does sense she needs to escape from here obviously i wont reveal the denouement but i can assure you it is quite dumb illogical and farfetched apparently rollin realized this as well because the explanation is kept very brief and quick theres a large number of overly weird and senseless sequences the sex footage is dire and filmed without passion the nasty makeup effects look cheap and randomly thrown without actual purpose as said the score is mesmerizing and brigitte lahaies perfect body is addictive to glaze at
