NEG its difficult to find anything worth of praise with this movie its not the worst picture ever made but thats not saying a whole lot the plot is quite incoherent and unbelievable it seems that the producers wanted to make a space movie but decided to make it underwater to cash in at the success of the abyss in some scenes it seems as if the story indeed was set to outer space initially the sub has a landing gear the technicians are worried of a rip in a rubber diving suit at the depths of several kilometers where the pressure would crush the diver and the suit like an empty beer can br br the movie starts out okay with planning of a recovery of a lost naval sub after that the movie takes a plunge along with the siren br br effects are soso the navigational screens are all done on commodore  remember this is  not  the sub is controlled like no other sub ever instead of control consoles the officers have keyboards with which they enter long number sequences to control various functions of the ship the interior of the ship isnt too convincing eitherbr br the final scenes leap from awkward to absurd welcome to the fifties you can check your suspension of disbelief at the doorbr br i fail to see enjoyment factor here the movie is neither good nor hilariously bad mstkstyle until you get to the final scene its like eating a slightly bad apple
