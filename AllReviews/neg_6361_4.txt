NEG basically the first two critters movie were already silly ones but in a good and entertaining way this movie is way more of a bmovie that is silly but for all of the wrong reasonsbr br this is the first sequel that doesnt really follows the plot of the first two movies basically all of the characters are new and there are no bounty hunters this time well as good as none since the bounty hunter in this movie shows up far too late and the budget for this one obviously went down again to save even more costs the movie got shot backtoback with part  which i imaging will be just as bad since it directly follows this movie and got made by the same people involved as with this onebr br its just a typical bgenre movie that doesnt really have any originality in it or brings entertainment it makes critters  a real redundant sequel you can easily do without granted that things could had been way worse for this movie but it just aint exactly a good one either the movie just falls flat as a sciencefictionhorrorcomedybr br also kind of strange to notice how the critters has suddenly changed in this one they are about double their usual size this time without giving an explanation for that and they are even more gremlins like in this movie than was the case in the previous onebr br the movie is only made interesting because this was the feature film debut of leonardo dicaprio he was about  in this movie and of course looking babyfaced like he still does now i like watching this well known actors in their early roles its fun to see how they act and if their style has improved and changed over the years of course dicaprio got only better but he already was kind of delivering his lines in the same way as he does these daysbr br really a too silly and lame moviebr br
