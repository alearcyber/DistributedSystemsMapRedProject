NEG i was forced to watch this film for my world reigonal geography class this film is what is wrong with america today instead of figuring out the best way out of hard times or situations we would rather complain about how it is someone elses fault this film goes through the downfall of flint michigan and blames it  on general motors in the process of doing so moore goes to great lengths to make the executives of general motors out to be villains just because they are doing their job in a capitalist society moore films several evictions throughout the film and does not ever even ask once if the person is being evicted because of a gm layoff additionally he never interviews the landlords of the tenants filmed moore goes to great lengths to twist historical events to fit his political agenda in this film of pure propaganda
