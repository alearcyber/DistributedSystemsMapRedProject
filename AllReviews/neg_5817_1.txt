NEG im a huge lover of really bad b movies and i especially love alienscifi movies i say the cheaper cheesier and campier the better a low budget and a hokey idea are fun enough for most bad b movies but this movie is so bad that i really felt embarrassed for the people who made the movie and for the schlocky adlib actors first off theres no real plot its all sort of situation comedy if it can be called that the comedy in this movie is more about characters saying in essence look at me im in this crazy situation isnt this funny but its only pathetic because nothing anyones doing is that funny theres no comedic acting skill nor any kooky plot to carry all the very unimaginative scenarios through this dreary turdbr br the bad comedy and lack of anything remotely comical is only worsened by the bad adlib acting actors saying really stupid things over and over again perhaps trying to ape for catch phrases perhaps just bc everyone in this is so bad really unattractive women being played off as hot chicks and people barfing and passing out in bathroomsbr br there was one middle aged actor toward the end of the movie who i could tell had some acting chops and was kinda convincing in his role he was as out of place as a solid bm in a weekend detox units bathroom corey feldman was filmed for about  minutes in total thankfully we didnt have to put up with him any longer and he was filmed off site  probably outside his apartment on the way out somewhere he said a few really unfunny things about aliens and having sex with aliens and that was the extent of his appearancebr br if you value your life and the  minutes and years of pain in remembering youll lose by watching this garbage avoid it if you do a lot of drugs like adam sandlers comedy stylings and thus have no standards whatsoever and are considered mentally slow you might like this movie br br ps i think the people who raved about this must work for troma or something bc i cant believe people can be so lame as to actually enjoy this movie do drugs really ruin your judgment that much
