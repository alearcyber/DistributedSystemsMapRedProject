POS eric bogosian gives as great a performance as youll ever see in an oliver stone film his barry character is an assault rifle disguised as a man and he blows away anyone on or off the air that offends him adapted from bogosians stage play talk radio is a vicious and frightening ride that doesnt let you off until its too late by then youve become familiar with the fringe of racists rapists paranoids wannabe assassins and mere prank callers who listen speak and lurk in the dark of dallas nights br br stone behaves himself if thats even possible letting bogosian dominate every scene from barrys humble beginnings to the make or break point when his radio show can reach national syndication the rest of the cast are uniformly excellent as the lovers andor coworkers that all have being used and tossed aside by barry in common br br the only thing id change is the recurring theme music bad to the bone id have used bachmanturner overdrives not fragile a better song one i havent heard in a film so far and a driving relentless tune whose ominous riff is like the true soundtrack to barrys lifebr br listen if you dare
