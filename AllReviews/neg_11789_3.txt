NEG i really wanted to like this movie great cast  walter pidgeon in a role that reminds us of his iconic forbidden planet barbara eden and robert sterling as young lovers frankie avalon as a musically inclined sailor is a guy on a submarine a sailor even peter lorre as a scientist with a fondness for sharks maybe its a good kiddie movie but i had trouble staying awake lorre was severely underused i guess he was a red herring like pidgeon  you expect him to maybe go nuts and try to throw the hero or his gal in the shark tank no such luck by the way why is there a shark tank on a submarine its typical of the movies lack of ambition they explain why lorre is walking the shark back and forth because were seeing it but just expect us to accept the fact that theres a shark on this sub for some reason research yeah scientists are always doing that research stuff who can understand them of course if there wasnt a shark who would kill the evil psychologist lady joan fontaine im sorry but even kids movies in the s are capable of being less predictable and frankly idiotic not to mention exploitativebr br the first  or  minutes really got my hopes up great theme song sung by frankie avalon pidgeon leading floyd the barber howard mcnear actually sorry howie loved ya in blue hawaii and joan fontaine on a guided tour careful to skip the room with the huge warning sign on the door past peter lorre with aforementioned sharks and then we see a full screen shot of eden shaking her moneymaker to avalons impassioned horn playing the movie quickly goes downstream from there theres no real explanation for the firestorm threatening the earth so theres a distinct lack of dramatic tension and no villain to boot instead pidgeons character is made into an unconvincing red herring vaguely of the ahab variety i guess the caine mutiny was still fresh in peoples minds and fontaines character suddenly turns evil for no reason at the end oh i suppose the reason is that its a surprise for the audience and it is kind of surprising since the only negative thing shes done is to talk bad about the captains mental health and theres still no reason why she did the sabotage after shes revealed to be the villain very poorly done and unconvincing the guy who was the pessimistic bible nut was better  at least his character made sensebr br so what else could go wrong endless interminable scubadiving footage i never understand the appeal of that kind of thing a giant squid attacks the ship for a minute just so theres a monster for the theatrical trailer maybe that fooled some people into thinking it was going to be a fantasy adventure film instead of a halfbaked suspense movie about military scientists who are never wrong yes  perhaps worst of all its barely a fantasy movie much less a science fiction movie it never did anything for my imagination because the whole premise was nothing but another disasterapocalypse and these characters never experience any feelings of wonder or discovery im through with irwin allen i never liked his later movies anyway but this one got me by pretending to be jules verne when its really just another formula exercise in disaster escapism the whole movie is just waiting to see which character will improbably turn evil and die he always hired an actoractress with a charming and personable screen persona to play these roles and thats the only element of surprise to be found since theres no logic to these characters anyway what a pathetic waste of time for these actors george pals movies are  times better the only one that was lame was atlantis which not coincidentally was the most allenesquire full of wonder and excitement and  think of it  ideas other than a few effects scenes and barbara eden theres nothing worth seeing here in my opinion i guess its good fun for those who are into disaster movies but i think they are a hollow and dull genre of films
