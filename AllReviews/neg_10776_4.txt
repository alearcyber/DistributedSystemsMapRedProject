NEG i seem to be disagreeing with a lot of folks here but i really did not find this movie as scintillating as the reviews i read claimed it was no doubt a touching story and the partition background provided the scope for an epic but the movie was a let down specially for neone who has seen gadar inspite of the lead being played by sunny deol and the incessant songs i must say gadar is the better of the two the story being virtually the same partition failed to create any depth in its characters as well as the scenes that were supposed to hav an impact over looking kristin krueks accent and the smallvile image which in itself wasnt an easy job the characters just did not seem too real not that i am criticizing the acting by any of the lead it just did not work the atmosphere was well drawn up but the movie really lacked in substance not that i am die hard rambo fan but some action cud have seen the movie through or some character development it all seemed like a rush to the finish and the ending only added to the viewers dissatisfactionbr br nonetheles i must say that it was at least a good effort in seemingly unfamiliar territory by the director and if u havent seen gadar then u mite even like it
