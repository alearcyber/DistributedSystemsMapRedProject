NEG i was debating between this movie and  but chose inglourious basterds due to its amazingly high imdb rating i must say now what a disappointment i expected a certain amount of gratuitous violence but i also expected a lot of witty dialog i got a huge dosage of the former but not nearly enough of the latter i felt shortchanged the ratio between violence to plot is very important and i think this movie gets it totally wrong and the plot its that believable or really all that entertaining either save your time and money i cant believe what this rating says for the gory and violent tastes of the modern masses
