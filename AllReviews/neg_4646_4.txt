NEG well ive read the book first and thought wow would this be cool to see in a movie than i started searching and found there was already a movie made of it i bought the movie a week ago on dvd and watched it they did it awfully wrong at first this kid hapiwho isnt any character in the book then the mix between the two books the river god and the seventh scroll than nicolas needing funds while in the book he himself is actually the funder the whole thing about the hyksos is wrong also taila is supposed to have invented the lightweightchariot the whole thing about the tomb is also very wrong there is supposed to be a channel that has some kind of vacuumsuction around it the tomb itself was made in a maze with only a possibility to pass if one knows the rules of the ancient boagame there was nothing in the movie about nicolas being english and royan was a copticchristian in the book not a muslimthis list is endless there were only a few things good about the movie the actors which played royan nahood taita boris mick and tessay were wellchosen the rest were just parodies of the characters in the book rasfer was the worst it didnt get even close to the character that was in my head while i wrote the book it is such a shame that such a great book is mutilated in such a bad reproduction i wonder why wilbur smith ever gave his permission for this
