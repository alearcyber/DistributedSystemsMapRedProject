NEG  out of the  comments on this subject rated this film as worth watching so let me redress the balancebr br if this is the best that british independent film makers have to offer then they need to pack away their cameras right now and find jobs in another industry unfortunately for me that was  minutes ill never see again and hopefully ill save some of you from wasting  minutes of your own br br whilst the idea behind the film is interesting it is not developed enough to keep the viewer attached the student characters are bland and uninteresting and quite frankly you wont care about what happens to them the soldiers are practically caricatures of every baddie ever seen in film i kept waiting for captain markovic to twirl an imaginary moustache some of the effects were quite good and showed some imagination but these were ruined by the shockingly bad acting poor script writing and patchy camera work the budget may have been better spent sending the actors and i use that term looselyto acting classes or the thomas brothers to film making school or maybe on a spell checker because the subtitles were incorrectly spelt the fact that the misspellings were not picked up on and rectified speaks volumes about the immaturity of the whole productionbr br i can only assume that the positive comments are staged by the film makers either that or they were watching a completely different film i implore the thomas brothers to never give up their day jobs for if they continue in this field they will surely starve to death
