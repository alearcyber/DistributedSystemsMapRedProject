NEG being stuck in bed with the flu and feeling too rough to get up to find the remote i actually watched this abomination from start to finish how many people can say that and for any who can  whats your excuse my god has there ever ever been such a total mess released by a major studio there is not one second of genuine tension in a supposed thriller the script is inept and ludicrous the sets look like they were leftovers from a lowbudget tv movie and the cast  what were they thinking sally field gives what is without doubt the worst and most embarrassing performance of any academy award winner in history her irritating nasal whine and stupidly perky behaviour in what is meant to be a lifethreatening situation are truly asinine its a wonder she didnt use all her future earnings to buy up and destroy every print of this turkey michael caine who now pontificates endlessly on the art of screen acting  even running master classes for wouldbe thespians  should be taken out and shot preferably by one of telly savalas henchmen angela cartwright an actress i usually like and whose name isnt even in the opening credits poor soul is ten years too old for her role and her horrible matronly yellow prom dress must haunt her nightmares to this day slumming it are karl malden and shirley knight  hopefully they collected a big pay packet to assuage their involvement the whole film is a series of bad scenes but one that especially sticks in my mind is the explosion which results in the ceiling if an upsidedown ships deck can be termed as such collapsing and a load of empty cardboard boxes falling through ooh how scary really really terrible
