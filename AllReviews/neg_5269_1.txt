NEG ordinary decent criminal is sort of based on the exploits of martin cahill already the subject of john boormans  film the general cahill had a rough upbringing in a slum area and graduated from petty crime to armed robbery with honours he justified his criminal career by pointing out his poor background at every opportunity this is a common excuse for criminals that conveniently overlooks the thousands of slumdwellers who dont turn to robbing post offices and selling guns in order to make ends meet cahill made fools of the police and local authorities not to mention the ira which earned him a sort of folk hero status as well as making him many enemies however he was basically an amoral selfserving thiefbr br my primary problem with odc is that the protagonist is made out to be a lovable irish rogue kevin spacey does a good job portraying michael lynch with a blend of oily charm and quiet menace but the character is too amoral and selfish to be seen as any sort of hero even an antihero br br the film is well shot and well acted by a fine cast but what lets it down is the script writer gerard stembridge cant make up his mind is he writing an irish lock stock or a grittier treatment of martin cahills thieving career thats the problem when a writer bases his central character on a real person br br its also unfortunate that odc followed the cinema release of john boormans the general which was a more accurate portrayal of martin cahills story cahill was a cunning thief who knew the value of good publicity so its not surprising that his exploits got the movie treatmentbr br what is surprising is that a studio was prepared to take cahills story and give it a happy hollywoodstyle ending kevin spaceys charismatictwinklybigamistthief michael lynch gets to ride off into anonymity on his motorcycle in odc in the real world martin cahill was executed by the ira just to prove that noone makes fools of an outdated sectarian and corrupt paramilitary organisation and gets away with it br br the real cahill would never have walked away from his notoriety because it bolstered his man of the people selfimage having michael lynch give up everything to avoid death in odc is a copout ending to a weak and shallow movie
