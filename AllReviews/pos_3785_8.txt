POS this film as it is now is far shorter than it was when released in  in fact it is now more available with two other medium sized silent chaplin features a dogs life and the pilgrim that chaplin rereleased in the s in its day shoulder arms was a big hit because of its humor in uniform approach it still is very funny chaplin in disguise as a tree spying on the germans is so ridiculous its hysterical but it suffers from being set in its own age charlies dealing with world war i a hideous conflict that killed  million people but not the worst war horrible to say of the th century chaplin would live to see that war too and would spoof its main architects in the great dictator but the latter is more accessible to modern audiences because that movie is a talking picture also hitler as a target seems more important to audiences in  than kaiser wilhelm ii and his general staffbr br shoulder arms was to take us through the drafting of the tramp his training his getting use to trench warfare and his actual fighting against the huns on the western front much of this is now gone  one segment when albert austin is a doctor examining chaplin in his office at the draft center is still in existence and was shown completely in the documentary unknown chaplin this is unfortunate because the film is now roughly forty five minutes long and there seems to be gaps that these scenes filled out what remains is first rate but one leaves wanting moreand feeling a trifle cheatedbr br sydney chaplin and henry bergman do well in supporting parts especially sydney as wilhelm he had done it before in a short with charlie for the sale of bonds giving a militaristic speech before being clobbered by the tramp with a huge hammer labeled war bonds here we see the tramp succeed in capturing wilhelm and the general staff at the conclusion it was only topped by stan and ollie capturing the german army with a tank and barbed wire in pack up your troublesbr br the funny thing is that chaplin actually had a major crisis as a result of his wartime activities he was not a naturalized american  not in  or in  when attorney general mcgranery publicly announced that chaplin could not return to the us because he was an enemy alien chaplin and his family were in europe on a trip  in anger charlie settled in switzerland for the rest of his life except when he made a countess from hong kong and when he went to hollywood for his special career oscar in the s because he was not an american he could not be drafted by the us so he sold with douglas fairbanks sr and mary pickford u s war bonds but in great britain tens of thousands had perished in world war one battlefields and the public there was upset at chaplin who they considered a slacker and a coward chaplin eventually did overcome this but remnants of the resentment followed him until he died this does not detract from the success of shoulder arms as a film but it does suggest why chaplin did not do another modern war film until  and a worthier target
