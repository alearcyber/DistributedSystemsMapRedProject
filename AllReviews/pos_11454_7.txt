POS the s is largely considered the decade in which horror decided to have fun sometimes there were some definite brains behind it all evil dead ii night of the creeps and return of the living dead for example and then there were those movies that were mindless but had a definite low rent charm and were perfect for a night with beer and friends movies like pieces and blood diner stacked rental shelves in the s and s offering little in intelligence or craftsmanship but plenty in dumb entertainment kevin tenneys  movie night of the demons is a part of this traditionstupid poorly acted and not an original bone in its body but dammit if you dont have a good timebr br the plot is so simplistic it just had to come from the s a group of dumb teens played by a bunch of actors in their mid to late s decide to go to a party at hull house thrown by angela mimi kinkade and suzanne scream queen legend linnea quigley well angela and co decide to throw a sance this turns out to be as will arnetts arrested development character gob would call it a huge mistake because a demonic force soon possesses angela and starts to get to the others as wellbr br take the evil dead a nightmare on elm street and your average dumb dead teen flick throw them in a blender and night of the demons is what you get the movie is anything but original and really its not a good movie the whole thing is insanely derivative the acting is terrible the jokes often fall flat the characters are annoying especially the character of stooge and the plot holes are numerous that out of the way its still a lot of fun so why br br well for one thing the make up and gore effects are top notch with some really memorable moments especially a nasty and just plane odd bit with a tube of lipstick that really stick out it also rarely if ever takes itself too seriously yet with the exception of some terrible puns plays it straight and never wastes the audiences time with winking self awareness plus theres a definite energy and enthusiasm to the whole enterprise thats almost impossible to resist yeah its nothing special but it knows that and it couldnt be more proud of that fact its a goofy party horror movie and it never pretends to be anything morebr br it might not be a classic but night of the demons is a good example of horror junk food done right it might not be too memorable or original but sometimes you dont want a fancy beer sometimes you want a budweiser
