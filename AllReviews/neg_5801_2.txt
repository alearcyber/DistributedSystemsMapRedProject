NEG alright how someone can actually think this movie is awesome is so beyond me i cant even comprehend how someone can find this movie remotely funny the only character it has going for it is the evil super nerd game designer and that gets old after a while this movie is so predictable the punchlines are not funny theyre forced you see better acting at the red light district and the story sucks its so predictable you know exactly whats going to happen even the characters do not react like they should try going to the hot chick that is your boss at work and telling her that youre banging  crazy chicks that you live with at the same time her response wouldnt be smile ok lets get back to work i didnt laugh once during this movie and i wish i had never seen it or spent  to rent it because thats not even worth it adam sandler produced this movie i have lost all respect for him all his movies are the same his comedy style got old ever since the waterboy came out if i knew adam sandler had produced this before i rented ittheres no way i would have wasted my time on it this movie is as bad as it can possibly get from every aspect ace ventura wasnt a smart comedy movie it didnt have a killer plotbut it was original and it was hilarious im not knocking the movie because it has lowlevel humor im knocking it because it sucks its a piece of hollywood crap if this movie was presented to a production company and dint have adam sandler behind it it would be thrown in the garbage quicker than a used condom if you want a good movie about potculture watch cheech and chong or whitecastle if you rent this movie all you will get is a generic comedy that targets  year olds with loud rock music at every possible cut acting that will make your eyes squint and your stomach turn and comedy that is equivalent to watching your stoned friend eating mcdonalds for an hour and a half dont do it for the love of godthis movie sucks treat it for what it is and look past all the hollywood glory behind ithercules in new york used to be the worst movie i had ever seen but its actually so bad its good this instead was a very expensive movie that sucked just as much if not more
