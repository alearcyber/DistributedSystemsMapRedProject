POS i was so happy to learn that hari om will finally be theatrically released in  i saw this film three years ago at the vancouver international film festival and have been waiting for its release ever since so i could send everyone i know to see it its like taking a trip to indiacolorful magical thought provoking aside from one rather strange hollywood style auto rickshaw chase scene this movie is very realistic this is not a bollywood style song and dance movie but it does have drama and romance and humor the interactions between the indian taxi driver and the french tourist are a good reflection on the fundamental differences between eastern and western life styles and philosophy the characters are a little broadly drawn but the acting was very good visually this movie is a treat as you really do get a sense of what driving through rajasthan is likedreamlike sometimes its hard to believe everything you are seeing and experiencing is realthe movie has that same quality great soundtrack too
