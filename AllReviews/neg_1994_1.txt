NEG i just saw this stinky old boiler on tv best watched with a very large flagon of dr jurds jungle juice at hand this exploitorific cheesefest is hilariously bad on the very slim plus side raquel was in her physical prime she looks good and you get to see a fair bit of her since she plays a gogo dancer she had great legs thats for sure theres also some minor interest for screen buffs in the footage of los angeles ca  and in spotting actors in minor parts who went on to better things veteran thesp ron rifkin brothers and sisters delivers a toecurling early performances as sailor the faggot junkie barman who rats raquel out to the bad guy you might also recognise the guntoting security guard in the hitandrun scene  its a very early appearance by gordon jump who gave such a lovely performance in soap as piece of chelief tinklerbr br the plot of flareup such as it is follows the travails of an exotic dancer welch on the run from her murderous exhusband luke askew this turkey is classic productionline hollywood sludge  a paintbynumbers script pedestrian direction hokey shots edits and effects ultracheesy stock music plywood sets and performances to matchbr br the cast is as uniformly dreadful as the screenplay although raquel is capable of fair performances in the right vehicle this wheezy old clunker is so bad that she doesnt really stand a chance and neither does the audience one of my favourite moments occurs when raquel awakes up in the hospital sees the vegas cop whos pursuing her murderous ex and asks how did you get here  to which he of course replies in a plane oh the humanity  and you wont be able to take your eyes off the doctor michael rougas who has what might well be one of the very worst walkons in the long sad history of bad cameos i dont think ive ever seen anyone stand in one spot so badly beforebr br raquels love interest joe james stacy ambles through the film with a fixed look thats somewhere between bemused and embarrassed  and no wonder this bomb puts the cast through just about every madefortv clich in the book from raquels spectacularly dreadful turn in the dreadful nightmare montage to the pure schlock of the romantic horse ride along leo carillo beachbr br spoiler warning  just about the only interesting thing in the whole film is the denouement in which raquel finally gets her own back and hilariously enacts the title by setting the baddie on fire whoever the stunt guy was really earned his money on this one  he goes up like yorba linda in a heatwave yet even this fairly spectacular scene is compromised by the fact that one of the crew moves into shot near the endbr br there are so many crappy things about flareup that its oddly compelling i found yourself wondering if this could be one of the worst films ive ever seen made the answer seemed to be a resounding yes  until i saw the film that followed it roger cormans megatrashy caged heat classic the big doll house which takes awful to a whole new level i can heartily recommend these two shlockers as a doublebill youll laugh yourself silly
