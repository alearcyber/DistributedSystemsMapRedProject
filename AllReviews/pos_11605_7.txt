POS i concur with what mallickab has said the movie is portrayed in a way which appears to be a kind of vilification on the original content emotions arent conveyed properly i guess a couple of notsogood performances also contributed to its mediocrity in my view tabu would have been a much better choice for such a role instead of aishwarya rai in some of her scenes she looks a bit lusty which is not ultimately what the movie should have portrayed i also noticed a bit of overacting in some of her scenes im a bitter critic of aishwarya rai  cant help it sorry for that raincoat was a good movie by rituparno ghosh and i saw choker bali after seeing raincoat i was not at all impressed
