POS as far as i know this was my first experience with icelandic movies its such a relief to see something else than your regular hollywood motion picture too bad that movies like this one have a small chance of succeeding in the big world i can only hope that people watch this by accident by recommendation or otherbr br because its really worth while i left the cinema feeling really sad i couldnt get the tragic destinys of the characters out of my head and it impressed me even more when i thought of the complexity of the film not only was it a tragic story it had excellent comic reliefs and a very good soundtrackbr br if you have the opportunity watch it its really thought provoking and made me ponder a lotbr br
