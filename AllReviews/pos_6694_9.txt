POS kpax is a very intriguing film is prot kevin spacey really an alien or is he a mentally deranged human who just thinks he is an alien that is the question that dr powell jeff bridges must answer before the self proclaimed deadline that prot sets for his departure from earthbr br as the film unfolds and more evidence is uncovered both theories grow in credibility his ability to map from memory the area of the galaxy where his home planet is located indicates a knowledge that no human could possibly possess yet the hypnosis sessions lead us to a real person with a very real and traumatic life filled with devastating events that could have caused such a personality aberration the ending seems to give the answer but is just ambiguous enough to make you wonder if you really know normally i dont like lady or tiger endings but this one is tantalizing i have my own theory that fits all the clues but i dont know that my theory is any more correct than anyone elsesbr br director iain softley wings of the dove spins the tale delicately with great skill this is a rare example of the director staying in the shadows and inducing outstanding acting performances out of talented actors to let the story dominate this is not to say that the directing is technically inferior because it is excellent however softley remains unobtrusive delivering great power through the use of subtlety a pleasant change from todays vanguard directors who visually grab and shake the viewer as if to scream look how brilliant i ambr br kevin spacey once again delivers a marvelous performance as prot this is a part that is extraordinarily demanding requiring spacey to render the cool and logical prot one minute and then switch gears to conjure his tormented alter ego under hypnosis the next spacey is so believable as both alien and human it makes the viewers task that much more difficult jeff bridges is also terrific as the relentless psychologist who becomes obsessed with learning the truth about protbr br this is inspired storytelling for the thoughtful viewer i rated it a  if you must have closure at the end of a film this movie will be very frustrating however if you like a fascinating mystery that keeps you thinking long after the credits you wont be disappointed
