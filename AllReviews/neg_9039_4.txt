NEG you would think that a film that starred three of the biggest male film stars of the post world war ii era would have become a classic these three who also happen to be three favorites of mine walk around in a daze looking like theyd rather be any place but therebr br the sad thing is that the way west definitely had some potential to be a classic in these days of political correctness a film about american pioneers and the travails of their westward migration is something not done now it should have been better done back thenbr br kirk douglas is a former united states senator whos heading a wagon train west to build a settlement in oregons willamette valley being hes an expolitician he rates above the hoi ploi hes leading the script calls for him to have not only a covered wagon but a carriage to lead the trainbr br you think thats ludicrous you ought to see the whipping scene where douglas orders his black servant played by roy glenn to whip him i wont spoil it by saying what causes douglas to demand this of glenn but trust me its badbr br robert mitchum is the trail guide and of the three stars he looks the most bored there was supposed to be considerable friction on the set between widmark and douglas but mitchum just saunters through the film above it allbr br maybe the friction helped somewhat because the movie calls for douglas a widower to have an eye on mrs widmark played by lola albright now shes the best looking thing in the moviebr br the film billing says introducing sally field this was made in between her gidget and her flying nun days she plays a piece of white southern trash with the musical comedy name of mercy mcbee we first see her in the movie sitting on the back of her parents wagon legs akimbo and inviting of course she gets taken up on her invitationbr br her character is something like whats found in every trailer park in america and then again what was a wagon train but one large trailer park on the move br br despite this film sally field went on to a two oscar career what that woman had to overcomebr br victor mclaglens son andrew directed this item and together with a lousy script turned this into a turgid mess shame on andrew mclaglen hes certainly done better in his careerbr br and so will you unless youre a stargazer
