NEG just as the whole cast and crew knows f all about film makingbr br this film concerns the adventures and predicaments of a modern day cockney vampire assassin and an age old spat with her seemingly jaded vampire lover that plot in itself reeks of clichs and promises of boredom when on as small a scale a film as this and thats exactly what you getbr br first off let me say that i by no means dismiss films because they are b movies in fact some of my favourite films are b movies such as jesus christ vampire hunter but this one misses the mark by a milebr br anyone with any knowledge of small budget films will know that the acting is rarely gripping and emotional but razor blade smile creates a whole new dimension of hamming it up on screen some of the so called acting is just indescribably bad with characters spewing cheesy one liners that fall flat and discourse expressing about as much emotion and conviction as the terminator after a couple of horse tranquillisersbr br a vast portion of the film is also taken up by the vampiric characters the protagonist in particular unnecessarily flapping their mouths showing off their ridiculously large vampire teeth and exhaling very loudly it literally must happen in almost every scene at least once and quickly became annoying and pointless as if that many looks of slack jawed supposedly scary vampire faces were used to merely fill a little bit of time and pad out the rest of this turd sandwich of a filmbr br contrary to what some of the other reviewers believe on here i feel this film the director in particular is really trying to take this film seriously in many parts the sheer number of overly dramatic action shots and extreme closeups seems to indicate to me that the director really wanted people to feel this film and make it legitimate to its genre and not spoof it and he fails miserably the attempts at supposedly tasteful sex scenes come out as comic and silly and the action sequences are sometimes just plain stupidbr br also the ending of this film was one of the weakest and most pathetic conclusions i have seen to a film b movie or not when films such as this force you to sit through hours of themselves only to be rewarded with a oh it was all a game ending it is actually sickening it the conclusion to the plot feels like an afterthought of the director that he figured out on the last day of shooting because they had run to the end of their shoestring budgetbr br but i have not rated this film as one star despite the overwhelming crappiness and this is because of the only plus point i can really give this film intentionally or not it was funny i am fairly sure the parts i found humorous were not intended to be and i found most of the efforts at genuine gags to be fruitless but when watched with friends it is a good film to take the mickey out of
