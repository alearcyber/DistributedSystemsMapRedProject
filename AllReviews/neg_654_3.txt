NEG okay this movie starts out and it looks like its going to be a cute comedy about a completely obsessed soap opera fan she has no touch with reality whatsoever outside of the soap sort of the inverse of the main characters in pleasantville and runs away to los angeles to meet a fictional character well it is a cute movie but at the same time it is also a dark very violent movie about two hitmen who are out to kill betty for reasons way to complex to recount here either plotline would have been enough on its own but nurse betty contains both stories at once and the effect is very jarring i didnt much enjoy it
