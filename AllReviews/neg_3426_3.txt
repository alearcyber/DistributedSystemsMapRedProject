NEG a very hypedup slick edgy reinterpretationbr br theyve fallen into the because its modern it has to be hypedup slick etc trapbr br romeo and juliet carried this idea off much more successfully but i really think its time we move beyond the two extremes here period piece vs edgy filmbr br just because this is a modern retelling doesnt mean the movie has to look like a magazine ad or have anything to do with drugs or gunsbr br if the trappings were as subtle as the honeyed words macbeth would be a far more powerful film as it is read your shakespeare read it out loud ask your oxford dictionary some questions skip the film or dont but youve been warnedbr br sorry for the superlong review imdb made me do it
